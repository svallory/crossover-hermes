## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Inventory Checking**:
   - For each item in the order_items list:
     - Retrieve the current inventory level from the inventory status
     - Compare requested quantity with available inventory
     - Determine if the item can be fully fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or is out of stock

2. **Order Status Assignment**:
   - Assign one of the following statuses to each order item:
     - "created": Full quantity is available and order can be fulfilled completely
     - "partial_fulfillment": Some but not all of the requested quantity is available
     - "out_of_stock": None of the requested quantity is available

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - For items with "created" or "partial_fulfillment" status:
     - Subtract the fulfilled quantity from the current inventory
     - Record the inventory update in the inventory_updates array
     - Ensure inventory never goes below zero

4. **Alternative Product Identification**:
   - For items with "out_of_stock" or "partial_fulfillment" status:
     - Identify suitable alternatives based on:
       - Same product category
       - Similar price range (Â±20%)
       - Similar style attributes
       - Current availability (must be in stock)
     - Assign a similarity score (0.0-1.0) to each alternative
     - Include up to 3 alternatives, sorted by similarity score

5. **Unfulfilled Items Handling**:
   - For items that could not be fulfilled (or were only partially fulfilled):
     - Add them to the unfulfilled_items_for_inquiry array
     - Specify the inquiry_type as one of:
       - "alternatives_needed": When suitable alternatives are available
       - "restock_information_needed": When no good alternatives exist
       - "custom_order_possible": For special items that could be custom ordered

6. **Priority Guidelines**:
   - Process items in the order they appear in the order_items list
   - For limited inventory, allocate available stock sequentially
   - If an email contains multiple orders for the same product, treat as a single order with combined quantity

7. **Special Case Handling**:
   - **Quantity Uncertainty**: If Product Matcher indicated uncertainty about quantity, default to lowest reasonable interpretation
   - **High Quantity Orders**: Flag orders with unusually high quantities (>10 of a single item) for additional verification
   - **Seasonal Items**: For out-of-season items with low stock, include a note in the alternatives about upcoming season availability

Remember: The accuracy of your order processing directly impacts customer satisfaction. Be precise with inventory management and thoughtful when suggesting alternatives.
