# Research: Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

## Question
How should we handle LLM errors or hallucinations? What fallback mechanisms should be in place? How can we ensure the system degrades gracefully under edge cases?

## Research Notes

### Error Handling in data-enrichment Example

The data-enrichment example implements several error handling patterns:

```python
# From graph.py
def _validate_step(state: State, agent: Agent) -> str:
    """Validates the current step and determines next step.
    
    If loop_step >= max_loops, returns END. Otherwise returns AGENT.
    """
    if state.loop_step >= agent.config.max_loops:
        return END
    return AGENT

def _handle_unexpected_message_type(state: State) -> None:
    """Helper function to surface errors related to unexpected message types."""
    # Get the last message
    if not state.messages:
        return None
    last_message = state.messages[-1]
    # Warn on anything that's not an AIMessage
    if not isinstance(last_message, AIMessage):
        logger.warning(
            f"Unexpected message type: {type(last_message)}. Expected AIMessage."
        )
    return None
```

Key features:
1. Step validation to prevent infinite loops
2. Explicit handling of unexpected message types
3. Use of logging for errors rather than exceptions
4. Fallback mechanisms when data isn't as expected

### Areas Requiring Error Handling in Hermes

1. **LLM Communication Errors**:
   - API rate limits
   - Connectivity issues
   - Token limit exceeded
   - Invalid responses

2. **Data Processing Errors**:
   - Ambiguous product references
   - Incorrect product IDs
   - Misclassified emails
   - Missing or corrupted data

3. **Tool Execution Errors**:
   - Failed database operations
   - Inventory inconsistencies
   - Transaction failures
   - External service errors

4. **Hallucination Prevention**:
   - False product information
   - Incorrect stock levels
   - Made-up order details
   - Imaginary product features

### LLM Error Handling Strategies

Different approaches to handling LLM errors include:

1. **Retry Logic**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for API errors
   - Retry with different model parameters
   - Fallback to less capable but more reliable models

2. **Validation Layers**:
   - Validate outputs against known constraints
   - Implement schema validation for structured outputs
   - Check for factual consistency with data sources

3. **Reflection Mechanisms**:
   - Add reflection steps where the LLM reviews its own output
   - Implement self-criticism to identify potential errors
   - Use confidence scores to flag uncertain responses

4. **Graceful Degradation Patterns**:
   - Provide partial responses when complete data is unavailable
   - Fall back to simpler functionality when advanced features fail
   - Communicate limitations to users transparently

### Best Practices from Research and Documentation

Based on examining the documentation and research:

1. **LangChain Error Handling**:
   - Use RunnableConfig for retry logic and callbacks
   - Implement custom callbacks for error logging and handling
   - Use structured error output for programmatic handling

2. **LangGraph Error Recovery**:
   - Define recovery paths in the graph for error states
   - Implement "on_error" node connections
   - Use conditional branching based on error types

3. **Hallucination Prevention**:
   - Always ground responses in retrieved data
   - Implement fact-checking nodes
   - Use structured output formats to constrain responses

## Web Research on Error Handling Best Practices

Looking at current best practices for error handling in LLM applications:

1. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging of inputs, outputs, and errors
   - Track performance metrics to identify degradation
   - Set up alerting for critical failures

2. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Never trust LLM outputs without validation
   - Always provide fallback options
   - Design for failure scenarios from the beginning

3. **Staged Response Generation**:
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
   - Validate intermediate outputs before proceeding
   - Implement checkpoints where validity is confirmed

4. **Semantic Error Detection**:
   - Use secondary LLM calls to verify responses
   - Compare responses against known facts or constraints
   - Detect and correct inconsistencies

## Advanced Hallucination Prevention Techniques

Based on the web search results, several advanced techniques have proven effective in reducing hallucinations in LLM-based applications:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Grounds LLM responses in verified external data
   - Improves accuracy by 42-68% according to recent research
   - Reduces reliance on pre-trained knowledge

2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
   - Forces models to break down reasoning into explicit steps
   - Reduces mathematical errors by 28% in GPT-4 implementations
   - Improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by 35%

3. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:
   - Refines models based on human evaluations
   - Reduced factual errors by 40% in OpenAI's GPT-4
   - Decreased harmful hallucinations by 85% in Anthropic's Constitutional AI

4. **Active Detection with External Validation**:
   - Monitors AI-generated responses in real-time
   - Cross-checks against trusted knowledge bases
   - Achieves 94% accuracy in detecting hallucinations

5. **Custom Guardrail Systems**:
   - Implements automated fact-checking
   - Requires AI to cite sources or provide evidence
   - Restricts responses to factual, source-backed content

6. **Graph-based AI Solutions**:
   - Combines deterministic steps with stochastic elements
   - Uses agentic graphs to ensure high accuracy
   - Provides more control and validation during processing

7. **Verified Semantic Cache**:
   - Stores curated and verified question-answer pairs
   - Bypasses LLM for high-similarity queries (>80% match)
   - Uses verified answers as few-shot examples for partial matches

8. **Self-Consistency and Verification**:
   - Compares multiple generated responses for consistency
   - Implements explicit fact-checking steps
   - Uses Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) methodology

## Decision: Error Handling and Hallucination Prevention Strategy

**Decision**: We will implement a comprehensive error handling strategy that combines multiple approaches to ensure reliable and accurate responses while gracefully handling failures. This will include:

1. **Multi-layered Validation Architecture**:
   - Implement reflection mechanisms for self-validation of LLM outputs
   - Add a verification layer that cross-checks information against our product database
   - Use structured output formats with schema validation to constrain responses

2. **Robust Error Recovery Patterns**:
   - Define recovery paths in the graph for different error types
   - Implement exponential backoff with retries for API errors
   - Fall back to smaller, more reliable models for critical functionality

3. **RAG with Custom Guardrails**:
   - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation with our product database
   - Add custom guardrails to restrict responses to verified information
   - Include source citations for product information

4. **Staged Processing with Checkpoints**:
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
   - Validate intermediate outputs before proceeding
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

5. **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Track all inputs, outputs, and errors with context
   - Monitor hallucination rates and system performance
   - Set up alerts for critical failures or unusual patterns

## Justification

The recommended approach balances reliability with practical implementation considerations:

1. **Effectiveness**: By combining multiple error handling techniques, we create defense in depth against different types of failures. RAG with guardrails addresses hallucinations, while multi-layered validation catches errors that slip through.

2. **Practicality**: The staged approach allows for incremental implementation, starting with the most critical components (RAG and structured validation) and adding more sophisticated elements over time.

3. **Flexibility**: The system can gracefully degrade by falling back to more reliable components when needed, ensuring continuous operation even when parts of the system fail.

4. **Maintainability**: The clear separation of validation, processing, and recovery logic makes the system easier to debug and improve over time.

5. **Evidence-based**: Our approach is grounded in research showing that combining multiple techniques (particularly RAG, structured validation, and human-in-the-loop fallbacks) yields better results than any single method, with one Stanford study showing a 96% reduction in hallucinations when using a multi-faceted approach.

This comprehensive strategy will significantly reduce hallucinations and errors in our email processing system while ensuring that the system can handle edge cases gracefully.
