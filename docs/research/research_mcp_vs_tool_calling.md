# Research: MCP vs Tool Calling for Agent Tool Integration

## Question
Should the ideal solution use MCP (Model Context Protocol) or traditional Tool Calling for providing tools to agents in LangGraph/LangChain?

## Research Notes

### What is MCP?
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard (originally by Anthropic, now widely adopted) for connecting LLMs/agents to external tools and data sources via a universal, language-agnostic protocol.
- MCP servers expose tools (functions) with input/output schemas; MCP clients (e.g., LangGraph agents) discover and invoke these tools at runtime.
- Communication is via stdio (local) or SSE (remote), supporting both Python and Node.js servers.
- MCP is now supported by OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, Cursor, and LangChain/LangGraph (see [LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/mcp-fad-or-fixture/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@h1deya/supercharging-langchain-integrating-450-mcp-with-react-d4e467cbf41a), [Athina AI Hub](https://hub.athina.ai/blogs/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-langgraph-agent/)).

### What is Traditional Tool Calling?
- In LangChain/LangGraph, tools are typically Python functions decorated with `@tool` and registered with the agent.
- Tools are defined and managed within the codebase, and the agent's prompts, system messages, and architecture are tailored to the available tools.
- This approach is highly customizable and allows for tight integration and optimization.

### MCP Integration in LangGraph
- LangGraph provides utilities to load MCP tools as native LangChain tools (e.g., `convert_mcp_to_langchain_tools`, `load_mcp_tools`, `MultiServerMCPClient`).
- MCP tools can be used with prebuilt agents like ReAct (`create_react_agent`) with minimal code changes.
- Example: 
  ```python
  from langchain_mcp_tools import convert_mcp_to_langchain_tools
  tools, cleanup = await convert_mcp_to_langchain_tools(mcp_servers)
  agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
  ```
- Over 2000+ MCP servers are available for services like web search, file system, databases, etc.
- MCP tools are modular, reusable, and can be swapped in/out without code changes.

### Pros and Cons

#### MCP
**Pros:**
- Universal, language-agnostic, and rapidly growing ecosystem
- Enables plug-and-play integration of external tools ("USB-C for AI agents")
- No need to write custom Python code for each tool
- Great for rapid prototyping, extensibility, and leveraging community tools
- Supported by all major LLM providers and agent frameworks

**Cons:**
- Less control over tool implementation and security ("rogue servers" risk)
- Tool descriptions and schemas may be less tailored to your agent's needs
- Some overhead in managing external server processes
- Not as tightly integrated as in-code tools; may require more prompt engineering for reliability
- For production, quality and reliability may lag behind hand-crafted tool integrations ([LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/mcp-fad-or-fixture/))

#### Traditional Tool Calling
**Pros:**
- Full control over tool implementation, security, and performance
- Prompts, system messages, and agent logic can be tightly tailored to the toolset
- Easier to optimize for reliability and production use
- No external server/process management required

**Cons:**
- Requires more custom code for each tool
- Less modular/extensible; harder to swap in new tools without code changes
- Not as accessible for non-developers or rapid prototyping

### Best Practices
- For **prototyping, extensibility, and leveraging community tools**, MCP is highly recommended ([Athina AI Hub](https://hub.athina.ai/blogs/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-langgraph-agent/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@h1deya/supercharging-langchain-integrating-450-mcp-with-react-d4e467cbf41a)).
- For **production, mission-critical, or security-sensitive applications**, traditional tool calling may still be preferable ([LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/mcp-fad-or-fixture/)).
- LangChain/LangGraph now make it easy to mix both approaches: you can use MCP for most tools and hand-crafted Python tools for core business logic.

## Decision
For the Hermes reference solution, **use MCP for integrating standard/external tools** (e.g., web search, file system, database access) and **traditional tool calling for core business logic** (e.g., catalog lookup, order processing, stock management) that requires tight integration, custom validation, or security.

## Justification
- **Rapid Prototyping & Modularity:** MCP enables fast integration of a wide range of tools, making the solution more modular and extensible.
- **Best of Both Worlds:** By combining MCP for generic/external tools and traditional tool calling for core logic, we maximize flexibility, maintainability, and reliability.
- **Community & Ecosystem:** MCP's growing ecosystem means more tools will be available over time, reducing the need for custom code.
- **Production Readiness:** For business-critical logic, in-code tools allow for better control, testing, and optimization.
