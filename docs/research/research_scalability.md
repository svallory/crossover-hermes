# Research: Scalability Considerations

## Question
How should we structure the system to handle a 100,000+ product catalog? What optimizations can we make for token efficiency? How can we ensure response time remains reasonable at scale?

## Research Notes

### Scalability Challenges in the Hermes System

The Hermes email processing system faces several scalability challenges:

1. **Large Product Catalog**: Managing a catalog with 100,000+ products presents challenges for:
   - Vector embeddings storage and retrieval
   - Context window limitations during product lookup
   - Response time for product search and comparison

2. **Token Efficiency**: LLMs have context window limits and token usage costs:
   - Large product details can quickly consume tokens
   - Multiple agent interactions multiply token usage
   - Lengthy email threads add to context size

3. **Response Time**: Customers expect quick responses:
   - Multiple sequential LLM calls add latency
   - Large vector database searches can be slow
   - Complex order processing might require multiple lookups

### Strategies from data-enrichment Example

The data-enrichment example provides some approaches for scalability:

1. **Efficient State Management**: Only passing necessary information between nodes
2. **Targeted Retrieval**: Using search queries to limit the scope of information retrieval
3. **Tool Design**: Creating specialized tools that return only the needed information

However, the data-enrichment example doesn't deal with the scale of a 100,000+ product catalog, so we need additional strategies.

### Potential Approaches for Product Catalog Scalability

1. **Vector Database Optimization**:
   - Hierarchical or clustered vector storage
   - Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms
   - Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword techniques

2. **Data Chunking and Retrieval Strategies**:
   - Product categorization for narrowing search space
   - Progressive loading of product details (basic info first, details on demand)
   - Attribute-based filtering before vector similarity search

3. **Caching Mechanisms**:
   - Caching frequent product lookups
   - Caching embeddings for common queries
   - Caching LLM responses for similar inputs

### Token Efficiency Strategies

1. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Concise instructions to agents
   - Removal of redundant context between agent calls
   - Careful selection of examples in few-shot prompting

2. **Information Filtering**:
   - Extracting and passing only relevant information between steps
   - Summarizing long product descriptions
   - Truncating historical context when not needed

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Using smaller, specialized models for simpler tasks
   - Reserving larger models for complex reasoning
   - Utilizing embedding-only operations when possible

### Response Time Optimization

1. **Parallelization**:
   - Running independent operations concurrently
   - Parallel retrieval from multiple sources
   - Batch processing similar tasks

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Non-blocking I/O operations
   - Background processing for non-critical tasks
   - Event-driven architecture for complex workflows

3. **Retrieval Optimization**:
   - Pre-computation of common queries
   - Database indexing strategies
   - Query optimization techniques

### Web Research on Scalability Solutions

Through our web research, we've discovered several key strategies and best practices for optimizing RAG systems to handle large product catalogs:

#### Advanced Chunking Strategies for Large Datasets

1. **Semantic-Based Chunking**: Breaking down products into chunks based on meaning rather than fixed size. For product catalogs, this means grouping related features, benefits, and specifications together rather than arbitrary divisions.

2. **Hierarchical Chunking**: Creating multi-level chunks where top-level chunks contain summary information (product category, name, key features) and lower-level chunks contain detailed specifications. This allows retrieval to first identify relevant product categories before diving into details.

3. **Adaptive Chunk Sizing**: Varying chunk size based on product complexity - simple products might be represented in a single chunk, while complex products with many features could be split into multiple chunks.

4. **Metadata-Enriched Chunks**: Attaching structured metadata to chunks to enable attribute-based filtering before vector search. This is especially useful for product details like price, category, availability, etc.

#### Vector Database Optimization Techniques

1. **Vector Indexing Optimization**: Using techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) for approximate nearest neighbor search can dramatically improve search performance on large datasets.

2. **Hybrid Search Approaches**: Combining sparse (keyword-based) and dense (semantic) retrieval for better accuracy and performance. This approach leverages traditional search techniques for structured fields and vector search for semantic understanding.

3. **Partitioning and Sharding**: Breaking the vector database into logical partitions based on product categories, reducing the search space for any given query.

4. **Progressive Loading**: Implementing a tiered retrieval approach where initial search returns basic information, with detailed specifications loaded only when needed.

#### Token Efficiency Best Practices

1. **Dynamic Context Management**: Rather than loading all product details, dynamically adjust the amount of context based on query complexity and specificity.

2. **Contextual Compression**: Using techniques to compress product information in a semantically meaningful way, preserving the most important details while reducing token usage.

3. **Strategic Chunking Boundaries**: Ensuring chunk boundaries preserve semantic meaning, avoiding information loss at chunk transitions.

4. **Context Pruning**: Removing irrelevant attributes or specifications from product descriptions based on the query context.

#### Response Time Optimization Strategies

1. **Retrieval Re-Ranking**: Using a two-stage retrieval process where a fast initial retrieval fetches a larger set of potentially relevant items, followed by a more precise but computationally intensive re-ranking step.

2. **Caching Strategies**: Implementing multi-level caching for query results, embeddings, and even LLM responses to reduce response time for common queries.

3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Using event-driven architectures to process complex queries in the background while providing immediate feedback to users.

4. **Parallel Query Execution**: Distributing retrieval operations across multiple computational units to reduce overall latency.

## Decision: Scalability Strategy for Hermes Email Processing System

**Decision**: We will implement a multi-layered scalability strategy that combines hierarchical vector search, dynamic chunking, context optimization, and a hybrid retrieval approach to efficiently handle the 100,000+ product catalog in our Hermes system.

### 1. Vector Database Architecture

**Approach**: Implement a hierarchical vector database structure with category-based clustering and metadata filtering:
- Organize product embeddings in a two-tier architecture: first by product categories, then by individual products
- Use HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) index for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
- Implement hybrid search combining vector similarity with structured metadata filtering

**Database Choice**: Qdrant or Milvus, which both support efficient operations on large-scale vector datasets with metadata filtering

### 2. Chunking and Embedding Strategy

**Approach**: Use adaptive semantic chunking with hierarchical structure:
- Create summary-level chunks containing essential product information (name, category, key features, price range)
- Create detail-level chunks containing specific product specifications, features, and compatibility
- Maintain cross-references between summary and detail chunks
- Incorporate metadata tags into chunks for efficient filtering (brand, price range, availability)

**Implementation**: Custom chunking pipeline that tailors chunk size and content to product complexity

### 3. Retrieval Optimization

**Approach**: Implement a multi-stage retrieval process:
- Stage 1: Identify relevant product categories using query classification and metadata filtering
- Stage 2: Retrieve candidate products using vector similarity within relevant categories
- Stage 3: Re-rank results using more precise relevance scoring
- Stage 4: Progressive loading of detailed product information only when needed

**Supporting Technologies**: Multi-query reformulation, query routing, and adaptive retrieval thresholds

### 4. Token Efficiency Framework

**Approach**: Dynamically manage context based on query requirements:
- Implement summarization for product descriptions when complete details aren't necessary
- Use adaptive prompt templates that adjust to query complexity
- Maintain a token budget for each query and optimize information retrieval to stay within budget
- Cache common query-response pairs to avoid redundant LLM calls

**Agent Design**: Structure agents to work with preprocessed, condensed information rather than raw product data

### 5. Response Time Optimizations

**Approach**: Leverage concurrency and async processing:
- Implement parallel retrieval from multiple categories when appropriate
- Utilize asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Batch similar operations to reduce overhead
- Prioritize critical path operations for real-time responses

**Infrastructure**: Use Ray for distributed computing and parallel processing to handle complex queries

### 6. Caching Strategy

**Approach**: Implement multi-level caching:
- Cache frequently accessed product embeddings in memory
- Cache common query embeddings and results
- Cache LLM responses for similar queries
- Implement time-based cache invalidation for products with changing availability

**Tools**: Redis or similar in-memory data store for high-performance caching

## Justification

This comprehensive scalability strategy is justified by the following factors:

1. **Hierarchical Vector Search**: By organizing our product catalog hierarchically, we can dramatically reduce the search space for any given query. Rather than searching all 100,000+ products, we first identify relevant categories, then search within those categories, improving both performance and relevance.

2. **Semantic Chunking**: Traditional fixed-size chunking would create arbitrary divisions in product information, potentially separating related features or specifications. Our adaptive semantic chunking ensures that product information is divided in a meaningful way, preserving context while optimizing token usage.

3. **Progressive Information Loading**: Not all queries require detailed product specifications. By implementing a tiered approach that starts with summary information and loads details only when necessary, we can reduce token usage and processing time for many queries.

4. **Hybrid Search Approach**: Pure vector similarity search may not be optimal for product catalogs with structured attributes. By combining vector search with metadata filtering, we can leverage the strengths of both approaches – semantic understanding from vectors and precise filtering from metadata.

5. **Parallel Processing**: Many components of our workflow can be parallelized, such as searching across multiple product categories. Ray provides a robust framework for distributed computing that will allow us to scale horizontally as our catalog and user base grow.

6. **Strategic Caching**: By implementing multi-level caching, we can avoid redundant computations and database lookups. This is particularly valuable for popular products or common queries, which are likely to form a significant portion of our workload.

7. **Proven Industry Practices**: Our research shows that similar approaches have been successfully implemented in e-commerce applications with large product catalogs, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

This strategy strikes a balance between computational efficiency, response time, and result quality. By optimizing each component of our RAG pipeline specifically for large product catalogs, we can ensure that our Hermes system remains responsive and accurate even at scale, while keeping operational costs manageable.
