# Research: Testing and Evaluation Strategies

## Question
How should we test each component of the system? What metrics should we use to evaluate performance? How can we ensure the system is robust to a variety of inputs?

## Research Notes

### Testing Patterns in data-enrichment Example

Looking at the data-enrichment example, we can analyze their approach to testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual components (tools, reducers, etc.) are tested in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: The entire graph is tested to ensure components work together
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures like response quality, accuracy, and latency
4. **Test Data**: Diverse test cases covering different scenarios and edge cases

### Testing Requirements for Hermes

For our email processing system, we need robust testing across several dimensions:

1. **Functionality Testing**: Ensure each component works as expected
2. **Accuracy Testing**: Verify that classifications, stock checks, and responses are correct
3. **Integration Testing**: Confirm all components work together
4. **Stress Testing**: Test system under high load with a large product catalog
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Handle unusual inputs, multiple intents, complex orders
6. **Hallucination Testing**: Verify factual accuracy of generated responses
7. **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

### Testing Strategies from LangGraph/LangChain Documentation

Based on reviewing the documentation and examples:

1. **Unit Testing LLM Components**:
   - Mock LLM responses to test dependent components
   - Create test fixtures for common inputs/outputs
   - Use deterministic LLM settings (temperature=0) for repeatable tests

2. **Graph-level Testing**:
   - Test the full graph execution with controlled inputs
   - Verify state transitions and node execution order
   - Test conditional edge logic with various inputs

3. **State Management Testing**:
   - Verify state updates are applied correctly
   - Test reducers with different input combinations
   - Ensure state is maintained correctly across checkpoints

4. **Tool Execution Testing**:
   - Test tools with valid and invalid inputs
   - Verify error handling in tool execution
   - Test tool output processing

### Evaluation Metrics to Consider

From reviewing best practices in LLM-based system evaluation:

1. **Classification Metrics**:
   - Precision, recall, F1 score for email classification
   - Confusion matrix for intent categorization
   - ROC curves for threshold optimization

2. **Response Quality Metrics**:
   - Relevance to user query
   - Factual accuracy (especially for product information)
   - Adherence to tone and style guidelines
   - Completeness of information

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - End-to-end latency
   - Token usage efficiency
   - Success rate of queries
   - Error rates for different components

4. **User-centric Metrics**:
   - Clarity and helpfulness of responses
   - Appropriateness of suggested alternatives
   - Satisfaction scores (if available)

### Ensuring System Robustness

Strategies to ensure the system is robust:

1. **Diverse Test Data**:
   - Create a comprehensive test set covering various scenarios
   - Include edge cases and adversarial examples
   - Test with different languages and writing styles
   - Vary complexity of orders and inquiries

2. **Adversarial Testing**:
   - Deliberately malformed inputs
   - Ambiguous requests with multiple intents
   - Requests for out-of-stock or non-existent products
   - Unusual language patterns or slang

3. **Red Teaming**:
   - Have team members try to "break" the system
   - Document failure modes and corner cases
   - Continuously expand test suite with discovered issues

4. **Regression Test Suite**:
   - Maintain a growing set of tests as issues are discovered
   - Run regression tests after any significant changes
   - Include previously problematic inputs

## Web Research on Testing Strategies

Research on current testing practices for LLM applications reveals several key frameworks and approaches:

### Testing Frameworks and Tools

1. **LangSmith Evaluation Framework**:
   - Provides capabilities for creating datasets, running evaluations, and tracking results
   - Includes integration with Pytest and Vitest/Jest for familiar testing experiences
   - Offers metrics beyond simple pass/fail and allows sharing results across teams

2. **pytest-langchain**:
   - A specialized testing library for LangChain projects
   - Allows pytest-style testing for chains and agents
   - Supports configurable test cases via YAML files

3. **LangChain Standard Tests**:
   - Pre-defined tests for ensuring consistency across LangChain components
   - Includes both unit and integration test templates
   - Allows subclassing of test classes like `ToolsUnitTests` or `ToolsIntegrationTests`

### Best Practices from the Community

1. **Mocking LLM Responses**:
   - Use stateful mocking to simulate deterministic LLM responses
   - Cache real model outputs to speed up testing and reduce costs
   - Keep temperature settings low (or zero) for more deterministic behavior

2. **Graph Testing Approaches**:
   - Test nodes individually with unit tests
   - Replace nodes with mocks to test graph routing logic
   - Run end-to-end integration tests with cached model outputs

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Automatically run evaluations against test datasets
   - Track metrics over time to detect performance regressions
   - Define pass/fail criteria for automated quality gates

4. **Online vs. Offline Evaluation**:
   - Offline evaluation: Test against curated datasets as part of the development cycle
   - Online evaluation: Monitor production performance and gather feedback in real-time

## Decision: Testing and Evaluation Strategy for Hermes

**Decision**: We will implement a comprehensive three-tiered testing and evaluation strategy that combines unit testing, graph-level testing, and end-to-end evaluation to ensure our Hermes implementation is robust, accurate, and reliable.

### 1. Unit Testing Layer

**Approach**: Test individual components in isolation with mocked dependencies:
- Agent prompts: Test with mock LLM responses to validate prompt effectiveness
- Reducers: Verify state transformations work correctly with various inputs
- Tools: Test with mocked data access layers to validate functionality
- State classes: Validate annotations and default values

**Framework**: Implement using standard Pytest with LangChain's standard testing classes where appropriate.

**Metrics**: Focus on functional correctness and edge case handling.

### 2. Graph-Level Testing

**Approach**: Test the flow of data through the graph with mocked agent nodes:
- Mock specialized agent nodes to return predefined outputs
- Test supervisor routing logic to ensure correct agent selection
- Validate state transformations across the entire graph
- Test error recovery paths and graceful degradation

**Framework**: Use LangSmith's Pytest integration to capture detailed traces and metrics.

**Metrics**: Measure state transition correctness and routing accuracy.

### 3. End-to-End Evaluation

**Approach**: Evaluate the complete system against a comprehensive dataset:
- Create a diverse test dataset with varied email types, order scenarios, and edge cases
- Include examples with mixed intents, unusual phrasing, and potential ambiguities
- Test with realistic product catalog data at scale

**Framework**: Use LangSmith's evaluation framework with custom metrics.

**Metrics**:
- **Classification accuracy**: Precision, recall, and F1 score for intent classification
- **Order processing accuracy**: Correctness of stock information and alternative suggestions
- **Response quality**: Relevance, clarity, and adherence to style guidelines
- **Factual accuracy**: Percentage of hallucinations or incorrect product information
- **Performance**: Token usage and latency measurements

### 4. Continuous Improvement System

**Approach**: Implement a feedback loop for ongoing refinement:
- Log problematic inputs and responses in production
- Automatically add failing cases to the test suite
- Regularly review and update test datasets as new patterns emerge

**Framework**: Use LangSmith's annotation queues and dataset management features.

**Metrics**: Track improvement in evaluation metrics over time.

### 5. CI/CD Integration

**Approach**: Automate testing as part of the deployment pipeline:
- Run unit and graph tests on every PR
- Run end-to-end evaluations on main branch commits
- Define baseline quality thresholds that must be met for deployment

**Framework**: GitHub Actions with LangSmith integrations.

**Metrics**: Pass/fail based on predefined thresholds for key metrics.

## Justification

This comprehensive testing and evaluation strategy is justified by several factors:

1. **Multi-layered verification**: By testing at unit, graph, and end-to-end levels, we can identify issues more precisely and ensure complete coverage. This is particularly important for complex, stateful LLM applications where bugs can appear at the component level or in component interactions.

2. **Balance between automation and quality**: Our approach automates much of the testing process while still capturing the nuanced metrics needed to evaluate LLM performance. This makes it practical to run tests regularly without sacrificing depth of evaluation.

3. **Industry best practices**: Our strategy aligns with emerging best practices in the LLM development community, using specialized frameworks like LangSmith that are designed specifically for LLM application testing.

4. **Continuous improvement focus**: Rather than treating testing as a one-time gate, our strategy builds in mechanisms for continuous learning from production usage, allowing the system to become more robust over time.

5. **Deterministic testing where possible**: By using mocks and cached responses for lower testing layers, we can make tests more reliable and faster to run, while still performing thorough non-deterministic testing at the end-to-end evaluation layer.

6. **Practical efficiency**: Our tiered approach optimizes resource usage by running quick, deterministic tests more frequently (on every PR), while saving more resource-intensive evaluations for significant changes.

This approach will help us develop a robust, high-quality Hermes implementation that can reliably process customer emails, provide accurate product information, and generate helpful responses across a wide range of scenarios.
