# Summary of src/hermes/agents/workflow/run_workflow.py

**File Link:** [`src/hermes/agents/workflow/run_workflow.py`](../../../src/hermes/agents/workflow/run_workflow.py)

This file contains the `run_workflow` asynchronous function, which serves as an entry point for executing the Hermes agent workflow. The implementation is nearly identical to `workflow.py`, providing the same functionality for workflow execution.

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

-   **Workflow Execution:** The main async function `run_workflow` takes the initial email input (`ClassifierInput`) and system configuration (`HermesConfig`). It prepares the necessary configuration for LangGraph and invokes the compiled `workflow` imported from `graph.py`.
-   **Vector Store Initialization:** Ensures the singleton `VectorStore` is initialized using the provided configuration before starting the workflow. This is crucial for agents that depend on vector-based product search.
-   **Configuration Management:** Prepares the `RunnableConfig` with the Hermes configuration in the expected format for LangGraph's configurable system.
-   **Input and Output Handling:** Accepts the initial `ClassifierInput` and returns the final `OverallState` after the workflow has completed, containing all intermediate results and the final output.
-   **Result Processing:** Handles both dictionary and `OverallState` return types from the workflow, ensuring consistent output format through model validation.
-   **Logging and Monitoring:** Provides informative logging throughout the workflow execution for debugging and monitoring purposes.

**Key Features:**
- **Async Execution**: Fully asynchronous workflow execution using `workflow.ainvoke()`
- **Type Safety**: Proper type annotations and model validation for inputs and outputs
- **Error Resilience**: Handles different return types from the workflow gracefully
- **Configuration Integration**: Seamless integration with the Hermes configuration system

**Note:** This file is functionally identical to `workflow.py`, suggesting potential code duplication that could be consolidated in future refactoring.

Architecturally, this file serves as the operational core that orchestrates the agent interactions defined by the workflow graph. It abstracts the details of workflow execution and configuration, providing a simple function call to start the entire email processing sequence. The initialization of the `VectorStore` ensures that the knowledge base is ready before any agent that might require it begins processing.
