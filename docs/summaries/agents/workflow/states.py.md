# Summary of src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py

**File Link:** [`src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py`](../../../src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py)

This file defines the `OverallState` Pydantic model, which serves as the central data structure for tracking the state of a request as it moves through the Hermes agent workflow. It also includes a utility function for merging error dictionaries.

**Key Components:**

- **`merge_errors()` Function**: A utility function that merges two error dictionaries, used for combining errors from different workflow stages
- **`OverallState` Model**: The central state container with the following fields:
  - `email_id`: Identifier for the email being processed
  - `subject`: Optional email subject line
  - `message`: The email message content
  - Agent output fields: `classifier`, `stockkeeper`, `fulfiller`, `advisor`, `composer` (all optional)
  - `errors`: Annotated dictionary mapping agent types to Error objects, with automatic merging capability

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

-   **Central Data Structure:** `OverallState` serves as the single source of truth for the ongoing email processing request. It holds the initial input (email ID, subject, message) and is updated by each agent node with its respective output.
-   **Aggregation of Agent Outputs:** It contains optional fields for the outputs of all five agents (Classifier, Stockkeeper, Fulfiller, Advisor, Composer). This allows subsequent agents to access the results of previous agents.
-   **Error Tracking:** The state includes an `errors` dictionary with automatic merging functionality to track any errors encountered by individual agents during their execution, mapping an agent type (`Agents`) to an `Error` object.
-   **Context Preservation:** By maintaining all relevant information in one state object, it ensures that the workflow has the necessary context at each step, facilitating conditional routing and final response composition.
-   **Forward Reference Handling**: Uses proper string literals for forward references and calls `model_rebuild()` to resolve them after all imports are complete.

In essence, `states.py` defines the schema for the data that flows through the Hermes workflow, ensuring that all necessary information is available and organized for the agents to perform their tasks and for the workflow to make decisions. The automatic error merging capability ensures that errors from different workflow stages are properly accumulated without manual intervention.
