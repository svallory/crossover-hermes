This file, `README.md`, provides a high-level overview and documentation for the Response Composer Agent. It serves as a guide for understanding the agent's purpose, how it fits into the overall Hermes workflow, its main components, and how it can be used and customized.

Key aspects covered:
-   **Overview:** Briefly describes the agent's role as the final step in the pipeline, combining outputs from previous agents to create a customer response.
-   **Purpose:** Lists the primary goals, such as generating personalized responses, adapting tone, ensuring completeness, and providing a quality customer experience.
-   **Components:** Mentions the key files within the `composer` directory (`models.py`, `prompts.py`, `compose_response.py`), and their respective roles.
-   **Usage:** Provides a Python code example demonstrating how to instantiate `ComposerInput` with outputs from upstream agents and call the `compose_response` function.
-   **Response Structure:** Details the elements of the final composed response (`Subject Line`, `Response Body`, `Language`, `Tone`, `Response Points`).
-   **Customization:** Offers suggestions on how developers can modify the agent's behavior, primarily through changing the prompt, adjusting LLM parameters, or extending the output model.

Architecturally, this README acts as essential documentation, explaining the Composer agent's position and function within the larger system to other developers. It clarifies its inputs, expected outputs, and dependencies, aiding in understanding the workflow and facilitating future development or modification of the agent.
