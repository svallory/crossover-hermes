# Summary of src/hermes/agents/composer/agent.py

This file, `agent.py`, contains the implementation of the Composer agent's core logic within the Hermes workflow. The main function, `compose_response`, takes the current `OverallState` (typed as `ComposerInput` for this node) as input and orchestrates the generation of a final, natural language email response to the customer.

Key components and responsibilities:
- Extracting relevant information from the outputs of previous agents stored in the `OverallState` (Email Analysis from Classifier, Inquiry Answers from Advisor, Processed Order details from Fulfiller).
- Selecting and invoking a suitable large language model (LLM) using the `get_llm_client` utility, configured based on the `HermesConfig`.
- Constructing the prompt for the LLM using the `get_prompt` function specific to the Composer agent.
- Creating a LangChain chain by piping the prompt to the LLM, specifically configuring the LLM to output a structured response (`ComposedResponse`) using `with_structured_output`.
- Executing the chain with the extracted and formatted data from the state.
- Handling potential errors during the composition process, including cases where necessary input data is missing or the LLM call fails. In case of errors, it attempts to return a basic fallback response.
- Returning the result as a `WorkflowNodeOutput` containing the `ComposerOutput` (which includes the generated `ComposedResponse`) or an error.

Architecturally, `agent.py` represents a crucial processing step that synthesizes information from disparate sources (Classifier, Advisor, Fulfiller) into a coherent final output. It relies on the shared state (`OverallState`) and interacts with the LLM service via the `get_llm_client` abstraction. The use of LangChain and structured output (`ComposedResponse`) ensures that the generated response adheres to a defined format, making it the final agent in the Hermes workflow before the response is delivered.
