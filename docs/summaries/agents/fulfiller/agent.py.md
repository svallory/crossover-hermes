# Summary of src/hermes/agents/fulfiller/agent.py

This file, `agent.py`, contains the core logic for the Fulfiller agent, also known as the Order Processor. Its primary function, `process_order`, is responsible for handling customer order requests based on resolved product information and applying any relevant promotions.

Key components and responsibilities:
-   **Order Processing:** Takes `FulfillerInput` (which includes `EmailAnalysis` from Classifier and `StockkeeperOutput` from Stockkeeper) to process order segments identified in the email.
-   **Stock Verification and Inventory Update:** Checks product availability using the stock information (presumably from the resolved products or a direct inventory check mechanism, though details are not in this specific summary but implied by its role and the `prompts.py` summary).
-   **Alternative Suggestions:** If items are out of stock, it is designed to suggest suitable alternatives (as per `prompts.py` and `README.md` summaries).
-   **Promotion Application:** It incorporates a system for applying promotions. The `README.md` mentions a declarative `PromotionSpec` system and the `prompts.py` mentions a fallback for tool-based promotion calculation. The agent prepares items for promotion application and potentially uses tools or LLM calls for this.
-   **LLM Interaction:** Uses a language model with a specific prompt (`get_prompt(Agents.FULFILLER)`) to guide the processing of the order, including structuring the output.
-   **Structured Output:** Aims to produce an `Order` object (from `hermes.model.order`) detailing the processed order, including item statuses, quantities, prices, and overall order status. This output is wrapped in `FulfillerOutput`.
-   **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for missing dependencies (e.g., classifier or stockkeeper output) or failures during LLM invocation.
-   **Integration with Workflow:** The `process_order` function is a node in the LangGraph workflow, designed to fit into the sequence after the Classifier and Stockkeeper and before the Composer.

Architecturally, the Fulfiller agent is a critical component for e-commerce operations within Hermes. It translates customer requests and resolved product data into a processed order, managing stock, prices, and promotions. It relies on upstream agents for analyzed email content and resolved products, and its output is crucial for the Composer to formulate the final customer response regarding their order.
