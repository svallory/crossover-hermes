# Summary of src/hermes/utils/errors.py

This utility module, `errors.py` within the `hermes.utils` package, provides helper functions for standardizing error handling and structuring responses from individual nodes (agents) within the LangGraph-based workflow of the Hermes system. Its main purpose is to ensure that both successful outputs and error conditions are packaged consistently for state updates in the graph.

Key components and responsibilities:
-   **`create_node_response()` function**: This is the core utility function in this module. It is designed to construct a standardized dictionary response that can be returned by any agent (node) in the LangGraph workflow. The function's behavior is as follows:
    -   **Inputs**: It takes two main arguments:
        -   `agent_name` (str or Enum, likely from `model.enums.Agents`): The name or identifier of the agent/node generating the response.
        -   `output_or_exception` (Any): This can be either the successful output produced by the agent, or a Python `Exception` object if an error occurred during the agent's execution.
    -   **Successful Output Handling**: If `output_or_exception` is not an exception (i.e., it's a successful result), the function creates a dictionary where the agent's successful output is nested under a key corresponding to the `agent_name`. For example, if `agent_name` is `"classifier"`, the output would be `{"classifier": <successful_output>}`.
    -   **Error Handling**: If `output_or_exception` is an instance of `Exception`, the function constructs a dictionary with a dedicated `"errors"` key. The value associated with this key will typically be a structured error object (e.g., an instance of the `Error` Pydantic model defined in `hermes.model.errors`) containing details about the exception, such as the message and the source agent.
    -   **Output Structure**: The returned dictionary is formatted to be directly usable for updating the shared state in the LangGraph workflow. LangGraph often expects outputs in a dictionary format where keys correspond to state variables or specific agent outputs.

Architecturally, `utils.errors.py` (specifically the `create_node_response` function) plays a vital role in maintaining a consistent and predictable structure for data flowing through the LangGraph state machine. By centralizing the logic for packaging both successful results and error information, it simplifies the implementation of individual agents, as they don't need to worry about the specific formatting requirements for graph state updates. This standardization is crucial for robust error propagation and handling within the workflow, allowing conditional edges or dedicated error-handling nodes in LangGraph to easily identify and process errors based on the presence and content of the `"errors"` key in the state.
