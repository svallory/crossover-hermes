# Summary of hermes/model/signal_processing.py

This module, `signal_processing.py`, defines the data structures for representing customer signals within the Hermes system. Its primary purpose is to provide a standardized way to categorize various types of information extracted from customer communications.

## Key Components and Responsibilities:

-   **`SignalCategory` Enum:**
    -   This is the sole component of the module.
    -   It's an enumeration (`Enum`) that inherits from `str` and `Enum`.
    -   It defines a comprehensive list of possible categories for customer signals. These categories are designed to capture nuances in customer interactions, such as intent, context, emotion, objections, and more specific details like product interest or budget mentions.
    -   Examples of categories include:
        -   `PURCHASE_INTENT`
        -   `CUSTOMER_CONTEXT`
        -   `EMOTION_AND_TONE`
        -   `OBJECTION`
        -   `TIMING`
        -   `PRODUCT_FEATURES`
        -   `URGENCY`
        -   `SENTIMENT_POSITIVE`
        -   `SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE`
        -   `BUDGET_MENTION`
        -   `PROBLEM_REPORT`
    -   The categories are aligned with examples typically used in prompts for language models that would perform the signal extraction.

## Relationships:

-   **Classifier Agent:** This model is likely used by the Classifier agent (or a similar component responsible for initial email/message analysis) to structure the output of its analysis. When the Classifier identifies a customer signal, it would categorize it using one of the `SignalCategory` enum members.
-   **Downstream Agents:** Other agents in the Hermes workflow (e.g., Advisor, Composer) would consume these categorized signals to better understand the customer's needs, sentiment, and context, allowing for more tailored and effective responses.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** The enum values directly correspond to categories expected or guided by prompts used with language models for extracting these signals.

Architecturally, `signal_processing.py` provides a controlled vocabulary for a critical aspect of understanding customer communications. By standardizing signal categorization, it ensures consistency in how customer inputs are interpreted and processed throughout the Hermes system.
