# Summary of src/hermes/model/errors.py

This file, `errors.py`, defines a set of Pydantic models used to represent specific, structured error conditions that can occur within the Hermes system. The primary purpose of these models is to promote standardized and consistent error handling and reporting across different agents and components of the workflow.

Key Pydantic models defined:
-   **`Error`**: This is a generic error model designed to provide a standardized structure for error responses originating from any agent or component in the Hermes system. It includes the following fields:
    -   `message` (str): A human-readable primary error message describing the nature of the error that occurred.
    -   `source` (Optional[str]): An optional field to indicate the name of the agent, function, or component that generated or encountered the error. This helps in pinpointing the origin of issues.
    -   `details` (Optional[Any]): An optional field that can hold additional context, technical details, or any relevant data about the error, which can be useful for debugging or more nuanced error handling.
    
-   **`ProductNotFound`**: This is a more specialized error model, inheriting from a base Pydantic model (likely `BaseModel`), designed to specifically signal situations where a product could not be located in the product catalog or database during processing (e.g., by the Stockkeeper or Fulfiller agents). It includes:
    -   `message` (str): An explanatory message detailing why the product search failed (e.g., "Product ID not found" or "No product matches the given name").
    -   `query_product_id` (Optional[str]): The specific product ID that was used in the search attempt, if an ID was provided.
    -   `query_product_name` (Optional[str]): The product name that was used in the search attempt, if a name was provided.

Architecturally, `errors.py` plays a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the Hermes system by standardizing error communication. By defining explicit error models like `Error` and `ProductNotFound`, agents can signal failure modes in a structured, type-safe, and machine-parsable manner. The generic `Error` model ensures a consistent error reporting interface across the system, while specialized models like `ProductNotFound` allow for conveying domain-specific error context. This is particularly beneficial in a multi-agent workflow like Hermes, as it enables downstream nodes or centralized error handling mechanisms within the LangGraph graph to programmatically identify, interpret, and react to specific types of errors more effectively than relying on generic Python exceptions or unstructured string-based error messages. This structured approach facilitates better monitoring, debugging, and potentially automated recovery or notification strategies.
