    def analyze_email(self, email: Email) -> EmailAnalysis:
        """Deep email analysis with segment extraction"""
        
        analysis_prompt = self.create_analysis_prompt(email)
        response = self.llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=analysis_prompt)])
        
        # Structured output with validation
        return EmailAnalysis.model_validate_json(response.content)
```

    def resolve_products(self, product_requests: list[str]) -> list[ProductMatch]:
        """Cascading product resolution: exact → fuzzy → semantic"""
        
        matches = []
        for request in product_requests:
            # Try exact match first
            if exact_match := self.find_exact(request):
                matches.append(ProductMatch(product=exact_match, confidence=1.0))
            # Fall back to fuzzy matching
            elif fuzzy_match := self.find_fuzzy(request):
                matches.append(ProductMatch(product=fuzzy_match, confidence=0.8))
            # Final attempt: semantic search
            else:
                semantic_matches = self.find_semantic(request)
                matches.extend(semantic_matches)
                
        return matches
```

        """RAG-powered responses grounded in product knowledge"""
        
        # Retrieve relevant products using vector search
        relevant_products = self.vector_store.search(inquiry.question, top_k=5)
        
        # Generate contextual response
        response = self.generate_response(
            question=inquiry.question,

    def create_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
        workflow = StateGraph(HermesState)
        
        # Agent nodes
        workflow.add_node("analyze_email", self.analyze_email_node)
        workflow.add_node("resolve_products", self.resolve_products_node)
        workflow.add_node("process_order", self.process_order_node)
        workflow.add_node("respond_inquiry", self.respond_inquiry_node)
        workflow.add_node("compose_response", self.compose_response_node)
        
        # Conditional routing - the magic happens here
        workflow.add_conditional_edges(
            "analyze_email",
            self.route_by_intent,
            {
                "order_only": "resolve_products",
                "inquiry_only": "respond_inquiry", 
                "mixed": "resolve_products",  # Handle both in parallel

            }
        )
        
        return workflow.compile()
```

### **Parallel Processing for Mixed Intent**
```python
def handle_mixed_intent(state: HermesState) -> HermesState:
    """Parallel processing for emails with both orders and inquiries"""
    
    # Split processing based on email segments
    order_segments = [s for s in state.email_analysis.segments if s.type == "order"]
    inquiry_segments = [s for s in state.email_analysis.segments if s.type == "inquiry"]
    
    # Process in parallel
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        order_future = executor.submit(process_order_segments, order_segments)
        inquiry_future = executor.submit(process_inquiry_segments, inquiry_segments)
        
        order_result = order_future.result()
        inquiry_result = inquiry_future.result()

    def run_agent_safely(self, agent_func: Callable, fallback: Callable) -> Any:
        try:
            return agent_func()
        except LLMError as e:
            logger.warning(f"LLM error occurred: {e}")
            return fallback()
        except ValidationError as e:
            logger.error(f"Data validation failed: {e}")
            return self.create_error_response(e)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return self.create_generic_fallback()
