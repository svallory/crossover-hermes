# ðŸ“¨ Hermes: AI Email Processing System

## Automated Customer Service with Advanced Language Models

---

Welcome to **Hermes** - an AI system designed to handle customer email processing with sophistication and reliability. The system classifies email intents, processes orders, and answers product inquiries using modern AI techniques.

### What This System Demonstrates

This solution addresses the email processing assignment through a multi-agent architecture that combines several advanced AI techniques. The system handles email classification, order fulfillment, and product inquiries while maintaining scalability to large product catalogs.

**The Assignment**: Process customer emails, classify intents, fulfill orders, answer inquiries, and generate professional responses - all while scaling to 100,000+ products without token limitations.

**The Implementation**: A multi-agent system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic vector search, and intelligent workflow orchestration through LangGraph.

### Technical Approach

The system addresses real-world email processing challenges: customers often mix orders with questions in the same email, product names contain typos, and traditional approaches fail when product catalogs grow large due to token limitations.

The solution uses specialized agents for different tasks, vector databases for scalable product search, and structured prompting to ensure reliable outputs.
