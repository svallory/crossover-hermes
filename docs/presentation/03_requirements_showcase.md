# ‚úÖ Assignment Requirements: Implementation Details

## Requirement Analysis and Solutions

Each assignment requirement presented specific technical challenges that were addressed through targeted implementation approaches.

---

## üìß Requirement 1: Email Classification
> *"Classify each email as either a 'product inquiry' or an 'order request'"*

### Implementation Approach

**Technical Challenge**: Real customer emails often contain both order requests and product questions in the same message.

**Where to find it**: `src/hermes/agents/email_analyzer.py`

**Solution Features**:
- **Mixed-intent detection**: Identifies emails containing both order and inquiry elements
- **Segment extraction**: Parses emails into functional components for separate processing
- **Language detection**: Handles non-English emails through automatic detection
- **Structured output**: Uses Pydantic models for consistent classification results

**Email Analysis Implementation**:
```python
# Structured email analysis with validation
class EmailAnalysis(BaseModel):
    primary_intent: str  # Main classification
    segments: list[Segment]  # Email components
    
    def has_order(self) -> bool:  # Order detection
    def has_inquiry(self) -> bool:  # Inquiry detection
```

**Output**: Compliant `email-classification` sheet with email ID and category columns

## üõí Requirement 2: Order Processing
> *"Process orders, verify availability, create order lines, update stock"*

### Implementation Approach

**Technical Challenge**: Order processing requires real-time stock verification, inventory updates, and handling of unavailable items.

**Where to find it**: `src/hermes/agents/order_processor.py` + `src/hermes/tools/order_tools.py`

**Solution Features**:
- **Stock verification**: Real-time availability checking with atomic updates
- **Promotion handling**: Automatic discount application based on business rules
- **Alternative suggestions**: Semantic search for similar products when items are unavailable
- **Order line tracking**: Complete status management throughout processing

**Order Processing Logic**:
```python
# Order processing with stock management
def process_order_line(line: OrderLine, config: HermesConfig) -> None:
    if current_stock >= line.quantity:
        line.status = OrderLineStatus.CREATED
        apply_promotion(line, get_applicable_promotion(line.product_id))
        update_stock(line.product_id, -line.quantity)
    else:
        line.status = OrderLineStatus.OUT_OF_STOCK
        line.alternatives = find_alternative_products(line.product_id)
```

**Outputs**: 
- `order-status` sheet: email ID, product ID, quantity, status
- `order-response` sheet: email ID, professional response

## üîç Requirement 3: Product Inquiry Handling
> *"Scale to handle 100,000+ products without exceeding token limits"*

### Implementation Approach

**Technical Challenge**: Including large product catalogs in LLM prompts causes token limit failures and high costs.

**Where to find it**: `src/hermes/agents/inquiry_responder.py` + `src/hermes/data_processing/vector_store.py`

**Solution Features**:
- **Vector database**: ChromaDB for semantic product search
- **Multi-strategy search**: Exact matching, fuzzy search, and semantic similarity
- **RAG implementation**: Retrieval-augmented generation for grounded responses
- **Constant token usage**: Scalable approach regardless of catalog size

**Scalable Product Search**:
```python
# RAG implementation for large catalogs
def retrieve_relevant_products(question: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[Product]:
    results = vector_store.collection.query(
        query_texts=[question],
        n_results=top_k,
        include=['documents', 'metadatas', 'distances']
    )
    return parse_vector_results(results)
```

**Output**: `inquiry-response` sheet: email ID, factual response

## üîß Technical Architecture Decisions

### Agent-Based Design
The system uses specialized agents rather than a monolithic approach, enabling:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent testing and maintenance
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Modular functionality

### LangGraph Orchestration
Workflow management provides:
- Conditional routing based on email content
- State management across processing steps  
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Parallel execution for mixed-intent emails

### Vector Store Integration
ChromaDB implementation enables:
- Semantic product search at scale
- Consistent performance regardless of catalog size
- Embedding caching for cost optimization
- Batch processing for efficient data loading
