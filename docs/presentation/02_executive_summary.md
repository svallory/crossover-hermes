# �� Executive Summary: Assignment Solution Overview

## What Was Built

Hermes is an automated customer service system that addresses the assignment requirements through a multi-agent architecture. The system handles email classification, order processing, and product inquiries using advanced AI techniques.

### Technical Implementation

- **5 Specialized AI Agents** working through LangGraph orchestration
- **Scalable Product Search** using ChromaDB vector database
- **Multi-Strategy Product Resolution** (exact matching, fuzzy search, semantic similarity)
- **Mixed-Intent Processing** for emails containing both orders and questions
- **Structured Output Validation** ensuring format compliance
- **Error Handling** with graceful degradation strategies

### Key Capabilities

**Email Classification**: The system analyzes emails to identify intent, handling cases where customers include both orders and questions in the same message.

**Product Resolution**: When customers mention products, the system tries exact name matching first, then fuzzy matching for typos, and finally semantic search for conceptual requests like "latest iPhone model."

**Scalable Search**: The vector database approach allows searching through large product catalogs without including entire inventories in LLM prompts, avoiding token limit issues.

**Professional Responses**: The system generates contextually appropriate responses, adapting tone based on customer communication style.

### Architecture Highlights

**Agent Specialization**: Each agent handles a specific task - email analysis, product resolution, order processing, inquiry handling, and response composition.

**LangGraph Orchestration**: Workflow management handles conditional routing based on email content, enabling parallel processing for mixed-intent emails.

**Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure structured data flow and validation throughout the system.

**Caching Layers**: Intelligent caching reduces API costs and improves response times for similar queries.

### Assignment Compliance

The system produces the exact output formats specified in the assignment:
- Email classification sheet with email ID and category
- Order status sheet with order processing results  
- Response sheets with generated customer replies

All outputs undergo validation to ensure format compliance and data integrity.
