# ITD-006: Product Matching Implementation Strategy

**Date:** 2024-07-29
**Updated:** 2024-12-XX (Implementation Review)
**Author:** Gemini Assistant
**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Context

Expanding on ITD-003 (Product Name/ID Mapping Strategy), this document details the actual implemented approach for matching product mentions in customer emails to specific products in the catalog. The implementation evolved from the originally planned LLM Extraction + Fuzzy String Matching to a sophisticated multi-tiered resolution strategy with LLM disambiguation.

The system handles diverse product references including:
1. Exact product IDs (e.g., "CBT8901")
2. Product names with variations and typos (e.g., "Chelsea boots", "chealsea boot")
3. Descriptive references (e.g., "black boots for work", "leather bag for laptop")
4. Ambiguous mentions requiring context-aware resolution

## 2. Requirements

* **Accuracy:** Maximize correct product identification across different mention types
* **Confidence Scoring:** Provide reliable confidence metrics for downstream decision-making
* **Robustness:** Handle variations, typos, plurals, abbreviations, and incomplete descriptions
* **Semantic Understanding:** Resolve descriptive product references using context
* **Disambiguation:** Handle cases with multiple potential matches intelligently
* **Performance:** Efficient processing suitable for real-time email processing

## 3. Implemented Multi-Tiered Resolution Strategy

### 3.1 Tier 1: Exact Product ID Matching

**Implementation**: `get_product_by_id()` using `find_product_by_id_tool()`

**Strategy**:
- Direct lookup by exact product ID match
- Handles various ID formats and normalizations
- Returns immediate match with 100% confidence

**Confidence**: 1.0 (100%) for exact matches

**Example**:
```python
# Input: "CBT8901"
# Output: Product(id="CBT8901", name="Chelsea Boots", confidence=1.0)
```

### 3.2 Tier 2: Fuzzy Name Matching

**Implementation**: `find_products_by_name_wrapper()` using `thefuzz` library via `find_product_by_name_tool()`

**Strategy**:
- Fuzzy string matching against product names
- Handles typos, plurals, and minor variations
- Configurable similarity thresholds
- Returns ranked candidates with similarity scores

**Thresholds**:
- `EXACT_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.95` (95% similarity for automatic resolution)
- `SIMILAR_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.75` (75% minimum for consideration)

**Example**:
```python
# Input: "chealsea boot" (with typo)
# Output: Product(id="CBT8901", name="Chelsea Boots", confidence=0.92, method="fuzzy_name_match")
```

### 3.3 Tier 3: Semantic Vector Search

**Implementation**: `search_products_semantically()` using ChromaDB via `search_products_by_description_tool()`

**Strategy**:
- Vector similarity search using OpenAI embeddings
- Handles descriptive and semantic references
- Searches against product names and descriptions
- Effective for context-based matching

**Example**:
```python
# Input: "black boots for work"
# Output: [Product(id="CBT8901", name="Chelsea Boots"), Product(id="WBT4567", name="Work Boots")]
```

### 3.4 Tier 4: LLM Disambiguation

**Implementation**: `disambiguate_with_llm()` using GPT-4o

**Strategy**:
- AI-powered resolution for ambiguous cases
- Analyzes email context and customer intent
- Provides reasoning for disambiguation decisions
- Handles complex cases requiring human-like judgment

**Triggers**:
- Multiple candidates with similar scores
- Ambiguity threshold: `AMBIGUITY_THRESHOLD = 0.15` (max difference between top candidates)
- Minimum candidates: `MIN_CANDIDATES_FOR_AMBIGUITY_CHECK = 2`

**Example**:
```python
# Input: "red scarf" with multiple red scarf products
# Context: "for my anniversary dinner"
# Output: Selects formal red scarf over casual based on context
```

## 4. Resolution Algorithm Implementation

### 4.1 Cascading Resolution Process

```python
async def resolve_product_reference_local(query: dict[str, Any], max_results: int = 3) -> list[tuple[Product, float]]:
    """Multi-tiered product resolution with confidence scoring."""
    results = []

    # Tier 1: Exact ID matching
    if "product_id" in query and query["product_id"]:
        product = get_product_by_id(query["product_id"])
        if product:
            return [(product, 1.0)]

    # Tier 2: Fuzzy name matching
    if "name" in query and query["name"]:
        fuzzy_results = find_products_by_name_wrapper(
            query["name"],
            threshold=SIMILAR_MATCH_THRESHOLD,
            max_results=max_results
        )
        results.extend(fuzzy_results)

        # Check for high-confidence match
        if fuzzy_results and fuzzy_results[0][1] >= EXACT_MATCH_THRESHOLD:
            return [fuzzy_results[0]]

    # Tier 3: Semantic search
    nl_query = build_nl_query(query)
    semantic_results = search_products_semantically(nl_query, max_results)

    # Convert to scored results (semantic search confidence estimation)
    semantic_scored = [(product, 0.8) for product in semantic_results]
    results.extend(semantic_scored)

    # Sort by confidence and return top results
    results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return results[:max_results]
```

### 4.2 Confidence Scoring Strategy

**Exact Match**: 1.0 (100% confidence)
**High Fuzzy Match**: 0.95+ (Direct from `thefuzz` similarity)
**Medium Fuzzy Match**: 0.75-0.95 (Scaled fuzzy similarity)
**Semantic Match**: 0.8 (Estimated semantic relevance)
**LLM Disambiguation**: 0.9 (High confidence for reasoned decisions)

### 4.3 Ambiguity Detection and Resolution

```python
async def disambiguate_with_llm(
    mention: ProductMention,
    candidates: list[tuple[Product, float]],
    email_context: str,
    hermes_config: HermesConfig,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Use LLM to resolve ambiguous product mentions."""

    # Check for ambiguity
    if len(candidates) >= MIN_CANDIDATES_FOR_AMBIGUITY_CHECK:
        score_diff = candidates[0][1] - candidates[1][1]
        if score_diff <= AMBIGUITY_THRESHOLD:
            # Invoke LLM disambiguation
            llm_result = await run_disambiguation_llm(
                mention_info, candidate_text, email_context, hermes_config
            )
            return llm_result

    # No ambiguity - return top candidate
    return {
        "selected_product_id": candidates[0][0].product_id,
        "confidence": candidates[0][1],
        "reasoning": "Clear top match"
    }
```

## 5. Enhanced Features

async def resolve_product_mentions(
    state: StockkeeperInput,
    runnable_config: RunnableConfig | None = None,
) -> WorkflowNodeOutput[Literal[Agents.STOCKKEEPER], StockkeeperOutput]:
    """Main entry point for product resolution within LangGraph workflow."""

    # Extract product mentions from classifier output
    mentions = state.classifier.email_analysis.product_mentions

    # Process each mention through multi-tiered resolution
    resolved_products = []
    unresolved_mentions = []

    for mention in mentions:
        query = build_resolution_query(mention)
        candidates = await resolve_product_reference_local(query)

        if candidates and candidates[0][1] >= SIMILAR_MATCH_THRESHOLD:
            # Check for ambiguity and potentially disambiguate
            if len(candidates) > 1:
                disambiguation_result = await disambiguate_with_llm(
                    mention, candidates, email_context, hermes_config
                )
                # Process disambiguation result...

            resolved_products.append(resolved_product)
        else:
            unresolved_mentions.append(mention)

    return create_node_response(
        Agents.STOCKKEEPER,
        StockkeeperOutput(
            resolved_products=resolved_products,
            unresolved_mentions=unresolved_mentions
        )
    )
```
