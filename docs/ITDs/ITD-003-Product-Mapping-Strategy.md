# ITD-003: Product Name/ID Mapping Strategy for Hermes PoC

**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Updated:** 2024-12-XX (Implementation Review)
**Author:** Gemini Assistant
**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Context

Task 2 (Process Order Requests) requires identifying specific products mentioned in customer emails and mapping them to their unique `product ID` in the product catalog. Customer emails often contain ambiguous, informal, partial product names/descriptions, or slight variations/typos (e.g., "blue summer dress", "Sleek Wallet", `CBT 89 01`). Analysis of `input/emails.csv` confirms that relying on product codes alone is insufficient. A reliable strategy is needed to bridge this gap and ensure accurate order processing.

This mapping occurs within the Stockkeeper agent as part of the LangGraph workflow, processing product mentions extracted by the Classifier agent and providing resolved products to the Fulfiller and Advisor agents.

## 2. Requirements

*   **Accuracy:** High precision in mapping diverse mention types to the correct `product ID`.
*   **Robustness:** Handle variations in naming, typos, plurals, incomplete descriptions, and semantic references.
*   **Integration:** Fit seamlessly into the LangGraph workflow and multi-agent architecture.
*   **Scalability:** Method should be efficient for searching against large product catalogs (100k+ products).
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Provide reliable confidence metrics for downstream decision-making.
*   **Professional Architecture:** Support production deployment requirements with comprehensive error handling.

## 3. Options Considered

1.  **Direct LLM Extraction & Mapping:**
    *   **Method:** Modify prompts to have LLM directly identify and output the corresponding `product ID`.
    *   **Pros:** Simplest integration (single LLM call).
    *   **Cons:** Relies heavily on prompt engineering, struggles with typos/precise name variations, potential hallucination, context challenges for large catalogs, limited confidence scoring.

2.  **LLM Extraction (Mention) + Fuzzy String Matching:**
    *   **Method:** Use LLM to extract product mentions, then use `thefuzz` for similarity matching against product names.
    *   **Pros:** Clear separation of concerns, robust to typos/minor variations, explainable matching.
    *   **Cons:** Limited to name similarity, less effective for semantic differences, single-tier approach.

3.  **Multi-Tiered Resolution Strategy:**
    *   **Method:** Cascading approach: Exact ID matching → Fuzzy name matching → Semantic vector search → LLM disambiguation.
    *   **Pros:** Handles all reference types, high accuracy across scenarios, confidence scoring, robust fallbacks.
    *   **Cons:** More complex implementation, additional dependencies (ChromaDB, vector embeddings).

4.  **Pure Semantic Search:**
    *   **Method:** Use vector embeddings for all product resolution via ChromaDB.
    *   **Pros:** Excellent semantic matching, consistent approach.
    *   **Cons:** May be less precise for exact name/ID matches, single approach limitations.

## 5. Decision

**Option 3: Multi-Tiered Resolution Strategy** was implemented, evolving beyond the originally planned fuzzy matching approach.

## 6. Rationale

The implementation evolved from the initially planned fuzzy matching (Option 2) to a comprehensive multi-tiered strategy (Option 3) to address the full complexity of product reference resolution:

### 6.1 Evolution Beyond Original Plan

*   **Initial Assessment:** Original analysis focused on simple PoC requirements with fuzzy matching as primary strategy.
*   **Implementation Reality:** Customer emails demonstrated diverse reference patterns requiring multiple resolution approaches.
*   **Production Requirements:** Need for high-confidence resolution across all reference types led to architectural enhancement.

### 6.2 Multi-Tiered Strategy Benefits

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Handles exact IDs, fuzzy names, semantic descriptions, and ambiguous references.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Early termination for high-confidence matches, cascading fallbacks for complex cases.
*   **Confidence-Driven:** Reliable confidence scoring enables downstream decision-making and quality assurance.
*   **Professional Architecture:** Production-ready implementation with error handling, logging, and observability.

### 6.3 Implementation Integration

*   **LangGraph Workflow:** Seamlessly integrates as Stockkeeper agent within multi-agent architecture.
*   **ChromaDB Integration:** Leverages vector store infrastructure for semantic matching capabilities.
*   **Tool Architecture:** Direct function calls via `catalog_tools.py` provide clean interfaces and control.

## 7. Implementation Details

### 7.1 Multi-Tiered Resolution Process

```python
# Tier 1: Exact Product ID Matching
def find_product_by_id(tool_input: str) -> Product | ProductNotFound:
    """Direct lookup with ID normalization and fuzzy ID matching."""

# Tier 2: Fuzzy Name Matching
def find_product_by_name(*, product_name: str, threshold: float = 0.6, top_n: int = 5) -> list[FuzzyMatchResult]:
    """Fuzzy string matching using thefuzz library."""

# Tier 3: Semantic Vector Search
def search_products_by_description(tool_input: str) -> list[Product] | ProductNotFound:
    """Semantic search via ChromaDB with OpenAI embeddings."""

# Tier 4: LLM Disambiguation (when implemented)
async def disambiguate_with_llm(...) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """AI-powered resolution for ambiguous cases."""
```

### 7.2 Confidence Thresholds

- **Exact Match**: 1.0 (100% confidence)
- **High Fuzzy Match**: 0.95+ (Automatic resolution)
- **Medium Fuzzy Match**: 0.75-0.95 (Consider for resolution)
- **Semantic Match**: 0.8 (Estimated semantic relevance)
- **Below Threshold**: <0.75 (Flag for clarification)

### 7.3 Tool Integration

```python
# Stockkeeper agent utilizes catalog tools directly
from hermes.tools.catalog_tools import (
    find_product_by_id,
    find_product_by_name,
    search_products_by_description,
)

# Vector store provides semantic search capabilities
from hermes.data.vector_store import get_vector_store
```

## 8. Architecture Benefits

### 8.1 Robustness Across Reference Types

- **Structured References**: "CBT8901" → Exact ID matching
- **Natural Names**: "Chelsea boots" → Fuzzy name matching
- **Descriptive References**: "black boots for work" → Semantic search
- **Ambiguous Cases**: Multiple candidates → LLM disambiguation

### 8.2 Performance Optimization

- **Early Termination**: High-confidence matches resolve immediately
- **Cascading Fallbacks**: Lower tiers only invoked when needed
- **Efficient Tools**: Optimized catalog tools with minimal overhead
- **Vector Store Caching**: Persistent ChromaDB eliminates reindexing

### 8.3 Production Readiness
