# ITD-002: Embedding Model Selection for Hermes PoC

**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Updated:** 2024-12-XX (Implementation Review)
**Author:** Gemini Assistant
**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Context

The Hermes project requires an embedding model to convert product information (name, description, category, season) into vector representations. These embeddings are essential for Task 3 (Handle Product Inquiry), enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by searching a vector database (ChromaDB, per [ITD-001](./ITD-001-Vector-DB-Selection.md)) for relevant product context based on customer query similarity.

The chosen model needs to:
*   Generate high-quality embeddings that capture semantic relationships between product attributes and potential customer queries.
*   Be easily integrable into the LangGraph-based workflow system.
*   Handle the embedding process for potentially 100,000+ products efficiently.
*   Be cost-effective for development and testing phases.
*   Provide consistent 1536-dimensional vectors for ChromaDB storage.

## 2. Options Considered

1.  **OpenAI Embedding Models:**
    *   Models: `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002`.
    *   Type: Managed API Service.
    *   Pros: High performance, simple API (client already needed for GPT-4o), no model hosting required, excellent LangChain integration.
    *   Cons: API cost per token, potential network latency.
2.  **Sentence Transformers (via Hugging Face):**
    *   Models: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `all-mpnet-base-v2`, etc.
    *   Type: Open-Source Library / Pre-trained Models.
    *   Pros: Free to use (compute cost only), runs locally, excellent performance, wide model variety.
    *   Cons: Requires library install (`sentence-transformers`), model download/loading, potential resource constraints, different vector dimensions.
3.  **Other Fine-tuned or Specialized Models (e.g., from Hugging Face Hub):**
    *   Models: Various domain-specific or task-specific models.
    *   Type: Open-Source Library / Models.
    *   Pros: Potentially higher performance on specific tasks if a relevant model exists.
    *   Cons: Increased complexity in selection, integration, and management; fine-tuning is out of scope for this PoC.

## 3. Comparison

| Feature                    | OpenAI Embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`) | Sentence Transformers (`all-mpnet-base-v2`) |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**                   | Managed API                                  | OSS Library + Model                         |
| **Embedding Quality**      | Very High                                    | High                                        |
| **Ease of Integration**    | **Very High** (Existing client + LangChain)  | High (Requires new library install/load)    |
| **LangChain Integration**  | **Excellent** (`OpenAIEmbeddings`)           | Good (Custom wrapper needed)                |
| **Vector Dimensions**      | **1536** (Consistent)                        | Variable (384-768 typical)                  |
| **Cost (Development)**     | **Very Low** (Est. ~$0.20 for 100k products) | Free (Compute only)                         |
| **Scalability (Embed)**    | High (Managed Service)                       | Medium (Local resource dependent)           |
| **Dependency Mgmt**        | Minimal (Uses existing `openai` lib)         | Adds `sentence-transformers`                |
| **ChromaDB Compatibility** | **Perfect** (Standard dimensions)            | Good (Requires dimension configuration)     |

**Notes:**
*   The estimated cost for OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` for 100k products (assuming ~100 tokens avg. text) is negligible (~$0.20), well within development constraints.
*   OpenAI embeddings provide consistent 1536-dimensional vectors that integrate seamlessly with ChromaDB without dimension configuration.
*   The `langchain-openai` package provides native `OpenAIEmbeddings` integration, eliminating custom wrapper development.
*   `text-embedding-3-small` offers excellent balance of performance and cost compared to `large` or older models like `ada-002`.

## 4. Decision

**OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model** is selected for generating product embeddings.

## 5. Rationale

Using OpenAI embeddings, specifically `text-embedding-3-small`, provides the optimal solution for this implementation:

*   **Seamless Integration:** Perfect integration with LangChain via `OpenAIEmbeddings` class and ChromaDB via `langchain-chroma`.
*   **Consistent Dimensions:** 1536-dimensional vectors provide standard embedding size for ChromaDB storage without configuration overhead.
*   **Performance:** State-of-the-art embedding quality captures product nuances effectively for semantic search and RAG.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Extremely low cost for development and testing phases (~$0.20 for full catalog embedding).
*   **Managed Service:** Offloads model hosting and inference computation, simplifying the architecture and avoiding local resource management.
*   **Ecosystem Compatibility:** Native support in LangGraph workflow and all related libraries.

This choice aligns with the project's goal of using integrated LLM tools effectively while maintaining professional software engineering standards.

    metadata = {
        "product_id": str(row["product_id"]),
        "name": str(row["name"]),
        "category": str(row["category"]),
        "stock": int(row["stock"]),
        "price": float(row["price"]) if row["price"] else 0.0,
        "season": str(row.get("season", "Spring")),
        "type": str(row.get("type", "")),
