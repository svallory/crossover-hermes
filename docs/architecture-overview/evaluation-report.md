    segments: list[Segment]  # Structured email decomposition
    
    def has_order(self) -> bool:
        return any(seg.segment_type == SegmentType.ORDER for seg in self.segments)
    
    def has_inquiry(self) -> bool:
        return any(seg.segment_type == SegmentType.INQUIRY for seg in self.segments)
```
