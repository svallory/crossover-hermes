This file, `enums.py`, defines several enumeration classes used throughout the Hermes system to represent fixed sets of values. These enumerations provide clarity, type safety, and prevent the use of arbitrary strings for concepts that have a defined list of possibilities.

Key enumerations defined:
-   `Agents`: Lists the names of the main agents in the Hermes system (e.g., `CLASSIFIER`, `STOCKKEEPER`, `FULFILLER`, `ADVISOR`, `COMPOSER`). These are used to identify the different agents programmatically.
-   `Nodes`: Lists names for the nodes in the LangGraph workflow graph. It's noted that these cannot be identical to the `Agents` names due to LangGraph limitations, so they use capitalized versions (e.g., `Classifier`, `Stockkeeper`). This highlights a distinction between the agent's logical name and its name within the specific workflow implementation.
-   `ProductCategory`: Defines the standard categories for products available in the store (e.g., `ACCESSORIES`, `BAGS`, `WOMENS_CLOTHING`). This is used in the `Product` model and by agents interacting with product data.
-   `Season`: Defines the seasons relevant to product availability or suitability (e.g., `SPRING`, `SUMMER`). This is also used in the `Product` model.

Architecturally, `enums.py` centralizes the definition of important categorical data used across multiple parts of the system. This approach makes the codebase more maintainable by avoiding hardcoded strings, improving readability, and ensuring consistency. The separation of `Agents` and `Nodes` also subtly indicates the relationship between the logical agent components and their representation within the workflow execution framework (LangGraph).
