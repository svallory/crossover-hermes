# Summary of src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py

**File Link:** [`src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py`](/src/hermes/agents/workflow/states.py)

This file defines the `OverallState` Pydantic model, which serves as the central data structure for tracking the state of a request as it moves through the Hermes agent workflow. It holds key information such as the original email details and includes fields to store outputs from each agent (Classifier, Stockkeeper, Fulfiller, Advisor, Composer) as they complete their processing. Additionally, it manages a structured dictionary for accumulating errors encountered by individual agents, mapping each error back to the agent responsible.

Architecturally, `OverallState` is crucial for maintaining a consistent and comprehensive view of the request's processing status, acting as the primary data container passed between workflow nodes. This design facilitates the flow of information and allows subsequent agents or workflow steps to access the results and status produced by preceding ones.

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

-   **Central Data Structure:** `OverallState` serves as the single source of truth for the ongoing email processing request. It holds the initial input (email ID, subject, message) and is updated by each agent node with its respective output.
-   **Aggregation of Agent Outputs:** It contains optional fields for the outputs of the Classifier (`classifier`), Stockkeeper (`stockkeeper`), Fulfiller (`fulfiller`), Advisor (`advisor`), and Composer (`composer`). This allows subsequent agents to access the results of previous agents.
-   **Error Tracking:** The state includes an `errors` dictionary to track any errors encountered by individual agents during their execution, mapping an agent type (`Agents`) to an `Error` object.
-   **Context Preservation:** By maintaining all relevant information in one state object, it ensures that the workflow has the necessary context at each step, facilitating conditional routing and final response composition.

In essence, `states.py` defines the schema for the data that flows through the Hermes workflow, ensuring that all necessary information is available and organized for the agents to perform their tasks and for the workflow to make decisions.
