# Summary of src/hermes/agents/workflow/workflow.py

**File Link:** [`src/hermes/agents/workflow/workflow.py`](/src/hermes/agents/workflow/workflow.py)

This file appears to be functionally identical to `src/hermes/agents/workflow/run_workflow.py`. It contains the primary function, `run_workflow`, responsible for initiating and executing the Hermes agent workflow defined in `graph.py`. It acts as an entry point for processing an incoming email through the LangGraph pipeline.

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

-   **Workflow Execution:** The main function `run_workflow` takes the initial email input (`ClassifierInput`) and the system configuration (`HermesConfig`). It prepares the necessary configuration for the LangGraph and invokes the compiled `workflow` (imported from `graph.py`).
-   **Vector Store Initialization:** It ensures the singleton `VectorStore` is initialized using the provided configuration before starting the workflow.
-   **Input and Output Handling:** It accepts the initial `ClassifierInput` and returns the final `OverallState` after the workflow has completed, containing all intermediate results and the final output.
-   **Entry Point:** This file serves as a high-level interface for starting an email processing task within the Hermes system, duplicating the role of `run_workflow.py`.

In summary, `workflow.py` is responsible for setting up the environment (like initializing the vector store) and triggering the execution of the main agent workflow, handling the initial input and returning the final aggregated state, mirroring the functionality found in `run_workflow.py`.
