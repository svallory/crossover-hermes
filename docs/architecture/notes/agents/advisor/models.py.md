# Summary of src/hermes/agents/advisor/models.py

**File Link:** [`src/hermes/agents/advisor/models.py`](/src/hermes/agents/advisor/models.py)

This file defines the Pydantic models used by the Advisor agent to structure its input and represent the factual answers generated for customer inquiries.

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

-   **Input Structure:** Defines `AdvisorInput`, which specifies the expected input for the agent, including the `ClassifierOutput` and optional `StockkeeperOutput`, providing context for inquiry handling.
-   **Inquiry Representation:** Includes `ExtractedQuestion` to model the questions identified in the email analysis.
-   **Answer Structure:** Defines `QuestionAnswer` to structure the factual answers generated by the agent, linking them back to original questions and referenced products.
-   **Aggregated Inquiry Response:** The central `InquiryAnswers` model aggregates the complete factual response, listing answered/unanswered questions, primary/related products, and unsuccessful references.
-   **Output Model:** Defines `AdvisorOutput` to wrap the `InquiryAnswers` object, serving as the primary output of the Advisor agent.
-   **Type Safety:** Ensures data consistency and provides type hints for the data structures involved in the inquiry handling process.

In summary, `models.py` for the Advisor agent establishes the standardized data formats for processing customer questions and presenting the generated factual responses within the Hermes workflow.
