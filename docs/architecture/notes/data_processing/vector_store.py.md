The `vector_store.py` file implements a singleton class `VectorStore` responsible for managing interactions with the ChromaDB vector store in Hermes. This includes initializing the database (supporting both in-memory and persistent storage), creating and populating the product catalog collection using data loaded from `load_data.py` (with batch processing for efficiency), and providing methods for searching products based on vector similarity. It uses OpenAI embeddings to vectorize product data and allows searching by description with optional filtering by category and other criteria. This component is crucial for enabling semantic search and retrieval of products within the Hermes system, supporting agents like the Stockkeeper and Advisor in finding relevant products based on natural language queries.
