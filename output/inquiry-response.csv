Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the RSG8901 Retro Sunglasses. We appreciate your interest in the style inspiration behind them.

The description for these sunglasses highlights that they are 'vintage-inspired' and offer 'a cool, nostalgic vibe'. While the description doesn't specify a particular decade like the 1950s or 1960s, they are designed to evoke a general retro feel.

We hope this helps clarify the style inspiration! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.

E012,"Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out! It's wonderful to hear that you loved the leather briefcase Emily got you last year for your birthday and used it daily. We're sorry to hear that the strap broke a few months ago.

Regarding your question about other messenger bag and briefcase style options, we understand you're looking for something potentially slightly smaller than your previous one.

While I can't provide a specific list of recommendations right now, we have a beautiful range of options available. I recommend visiting the 'Bags' section on the Hermes website, where you can explore our current collection of briefcases and messenger bags.

Alternatively, if you'd like personalized recommendations, please feel free to share a few more details about what you're looking for, such as preferred materials, features, or specific size requirements beyond 'slightly smaller'. Our team of experts would be delighted to assist you further in finding the perfect bag.

We look forward to helping you find your next favorite work bag!

Best regards,

E015,"Good morning,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand you're looking for a stylish and practical men's bag for your husband Thomas for your anniversary, something suitable for both work and hiking.

Finding a single recommendation that perfectly balances all these specific needs – style, practicality, and suitability for both work and hiking – can be quite specific. While we have a wide range of exquisite men's bags, identifying one that ticks every single box without exploring the collection further or understanding more about Thomas's preferences and the specific hiking context is challenging.

We invite you to explore our full collection of men's bags on our website, where you can filter by style, material, and features. Alternatively, visiting one of our stores would allow you to see the bags in person and speak with our knowledgeable staff.

For a more personalized recommendation tailored precisely to Thomas's requirements, we would be delighted to connect you with one of our personal shoppers. They can offer expert guidance and help you find the perfect anniversary gift.

We hope this helps you in your search for a truly special gift.

Best regards,
Hermes - Delivering divine fashion"

You may find inspiration among our elegant silk midis or chic A-line silhouettes which are often perfect for such occasions.

Regarding a travel bag, we offer a diverse collection known for both style and durability. To help narrow down the options, it would be helpful to know if you have a preferred size, material, or specific features in mind.
