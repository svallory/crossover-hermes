    response_body: 'Dear David,


      Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in our leather bags to carry your
      laptop and documents for work! I understand you''re deciding between the LTH1098
      Leather Backpack and our Leather Tote, and specifically asked which has more
      organizational pockets.


      Regarding your question, both bags are designed with organization in mind. The
      Leather Backpack (LTH1098) features multiple compartments and a padded laptop
      sleeve, making it excellent for keeping things separate and secure. The Leather
      Tote also offers a spacious interior with multiple pockets to help you organize
      your essentials.


      While the descriptions highlight these features, they don''t specify the exact
      number of pockets for a direct comparison. However, I can tell you more about
      each:


      *   The **Leather Backpack (LTH1098)**, priced at $43.99, is crafted from premium
      leather and is perfect if you prefer a hands-free option with dedicated space
      for your laptop. Its multiple compartments are great for separating items.

      *   The **Leather Tote**, priced at $28.00, also made from premium full-grain
      leather, offers a very spacious interior with its own set of multiple pockets,
      ideal if you like an open design with easy access.


      Both are excellent choices for work and are currently in stock.


      We also have a **Leather Messenger Bag (CTX_P3_MESSENGER_E003)**, priced at
      $37.99, which might interest you. It offers a spacious main compartment, multiple
      pockets, and an adjustable strap, providing a classic and professional look.


      I hope this helps you in making a decision! Please let me know if you have any
      more questions or if there''s anything else I can assist you with.


      Best regards,

      Hermes - Delivering divine fashion'
