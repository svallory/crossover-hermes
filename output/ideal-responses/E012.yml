  message: "Hey, hope you're doing well. Last year for my birthday, my wife Emily\
    \ got me a really nice leather briefcase from your store. I loved it and used\
    \ it every day for work until the strap broke a few months ago. Speaking of broken\
    \ things, I also need to get my lawnmower fixed before spring. Anyway, what were\
    \ some of the other messenger bag or briefcase style options you have? I could\
    \ go for something slightly smaller than my previous one. Oh and we also need\
    \ to make dinner reservations for our anniversary next month. Maybe a nice Italian\
    \ place downtown. What was I saying again? Oh right, work bags! Let me know what\
    \ you'd recommend. Thanks!"

      Hey there,

      Hope you're doing well too! I understand your leather briefcase met an untimely end – that's a shame, especially when it was a gift from Emily!

      No worries about the rambling, let's get you sorted with a new work bag. You're looking for messenger bag or briefcase style options, possibly a bit smaller than your last one. Here are a couple of recommendations:

      1.  **LTH2109 Leather Messenger Bag ($37.99):** This is a classic choice. It's made from premium full-grain leather, has a spacious main compartment, and multiple pockets for organization. It's a great all-rounder for work.

      2.  **LTH1098 Leather Backpack ($43.99):** If you're open to a backpack style, this one is also excellent for work. It features multiple compartments and a padded laptop sleeve, offering good organization and protection.

      You can compare the dimensions of these with your previous briefcase to see if they fit your preference for something a bit smaller. Both are durable and stylish for professional use.

      Let me know if either of these catch your eye or if you have more questions!

      (And good luck with the lawnmower and anniversary dinner plans!)

      Best regards,
      Hermes - Delivering divine fashion
