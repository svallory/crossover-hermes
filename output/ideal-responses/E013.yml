  subject: Issue with Sweater Dress Sizing
  message: "Hello, I recently ordered the Sweater Dress (SWT8765) in a size Medium. It arrived today, but it seems to run much larger than I expected. I usually wear a Medium in your brand, but this fits like a Large or even XL. Can I exchange it for a Small, or should I return it and re-order? What's your stock like for Small? Thanks, Sarah J."

      Hi Sarah,

      Thanks for reaching out about the Sweater Dress (SWT8765) and the sizing issue. We're sorry to hear the Medium ran larger than expected.

      We've processed an exchange for you for a size Small, which is currently in stock.

      To return the Medium dress, please use the prepaid shipping label that will be sent in a separate email shortly. Once we receive the original item, we'll ship out your new Small Sweater Dress.

      If you'd prefer a return and re-order, you can also use the label to send back the dress for a full refund, and then place a new order for the Small at your convenience. However, initiating the exchange directly will be quicker.

      Please let us know if you have any other questions!

      Best regards,
      Hermes - Delivering divine fashion
