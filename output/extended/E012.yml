  message: Hey, hope you're doing well. Last year for my birthday, my wife Emily got
    me a really nice leather briefcase from your store. I loved it and used it every
    day for work until the strap broke a few months ago. Speaking of broken things,
    I also need to get my lawnmower fixed before spring. Anyway, what were some of
    the other messenger bag or briefcase style options you have? I could go for something
    slightly smaller than my previous one. Oh and we also need to make dinner reservations
    for our anniversary next month. Maybe a nice Italian place downtown. What was
    I saying again? Oh right, work bags! Let me know what you'd recommend. Thanks!
