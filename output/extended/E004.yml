  response_body: "Dear Emma,\n\nThank you so much for your wonderful message \u2013\
    \ your excitement about our new spring collection is truly contagious! I\u2019\
    m delighted to let you know that your order for the Kelly Mini in Rose Sakura\
    \ has been successfully placed. This iconic piece is a favorite for a reason:\
    \ the blush pink Epsom leather and those signature gold accents make it both playful\
    \ and timeless. Your order is currently being processed, and we\u2019ll notify\
    \ you as soon as it\u2019s ready for shipment. The total comes to $8,200, which\
    \ already includes your spring promotion \u2013 a lovely little bonus to go with\
    \ your new bag.\n\nYou also asked about the difference between Epsom and Swift\
    \ leather. Epsom is known for its structure and durability \u2013 it holds its\
    \ shape beautifully and is resistant to scratches, making it perfect for everyday\
    \ elegance. Swift leather, on the other hand, is softer and more supple with a\
    \ subtle sheen, so it\u2019s great if you like a slightly slouchier look and a\
    \ silkier touch. Both are exquisite, but the Kelly Mini you chose in Epsom is\
    \ ideal for staying pristine even with frequent outings.\n\nSince you mentioned\
    \ building your Hermes collection, I thought you might also love our Constance\
    \ Wallet in the same Rose Sakura shade or the playful Twilly scarves \u2013 they\u2019\
    re perfect for adding a pop of color or tying onto your new bag for a bit of personal\
    \ flair. If you\u2019re thinking about something to pair with your Kelly Mini\
    \ for spring events, our Oran sandals in white are a customer favorite for a reason:\
    \ chic, comfortable, and effortlessly elegant.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information\
    \ about other leather types or styling tips for your new piece, just let me know\
    \ \u2013 I\u2019m always happy to help you curate your perfect Hermes look. You\u2019\
    ll receive tracking details as soon as your order ships, and in the meantime,\
    \ please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or need\
    \ personalized recommendations.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
