    \ choosing Hermes! It\u2019s always a pleasure to assist someone with such a keen\
    \ eye for style.\n\nI\u2019m delighted to confirm that your order for the Kelly\
    \ 25 handbag in gold togo leather has been successfully created. This iconic piece\
    \ combines timeless elegance with modern versatility\u2014truly a standout in\
    \ any collection. Your order is currently being processed, and I will notify you\
    \ as soon as it\u2019s ready to ship. The total for your order comes to $9,950.00,\
    \ and you\u2019ve received a $500 discount as part of our spring promotion.\n\n\
    You mentioned having some questions about caring for the leather and whether the\
    \ gold hardware can scratch easily. The Togo leather is known for its durability\
    \ and beautiful texture, making it a fantastic everyday choice. For the gold hardware,\
    \ it\u2019s crafted to resist daily wear, but as with all precious finishes, a\
    \ little extra care\u2014like storing your bag in its dust cover\u2014will help\
    \ maintain its shine for years to come.\n\nSince you\u2019re adding such a stunning\
    \ piece to your wardrobe, you might also enjoy our range of silk twilly scarves\u2014\
    they\u2019re perfect for styling the Kelly and protecting the handles. Many customers\
    \ love choosing a scarf with matching gold tones to tie the look together.\n\n\
    If you\u2019d like to explore more accessories or need help selecting a care product,\
    \ just let me know! I\u2019m here to ensure your Hermes experience is exceptional\
    \ from start to finish.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
