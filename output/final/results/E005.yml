    - answer: The CSH1098 Cozy Shawl is knitted from soft, warm yarn and is described
        as a versatile accessory that can be worn as a shawl, scarf, or even a lightweight
        blanket. This suggests that the material is suitable for use as a lap blanket,
        providing comfort and warmth, but it is also light enough to be worn as a
        thick wrapping scarf. It is designed for versatility and comfort, making it
        appropriate for both uses.
