E022,"Hi Monica,

Thank you so much for your excitement and for reaching out about the bags from our latest collection! I can absolutely feel your enthusiasm, and it's wonderful to see how much you love those geometric patterns that have been making waves on Instagram.

I wanted to let you know that, at the moment, we weren't able to identify a specific product in our catalog that matches the description of the ""amazing bags with geometric patterns"" in the darker shade you mentioned. It's possible that the style you saw on social media is either a limited edition, a preview, or not yet available for direct order through our current collection.

If you have any additional details—such as a product name, a screenshot, or a link to the post you saw—I'd be more than happy to take another look and help track down the exact bags you're after. Your interest means a lot to us, and I want to make sure you get the perfect pieces for your collection.

In the meantime, if you'd like, I can also recommend some of our current bags that feature bold patterns and elegant dark tones. Just let me know if you'd like to see some options!

Thank you again for your passion for Hermes. I'm here to help with anything you need, so please don't hesitate to share more details or ask about other styles.

Best regards,
Hermes - Delivering divine fashion"
