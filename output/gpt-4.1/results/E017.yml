  response_body: "Dear Ms. Laurent,\n\nThank you so much for your enthusiastic email\u2014\
    I can feel your excitement about the new season's collection, and it\u2019s truly\
    \ contagious! I\u2019m delighted to confirm that your order for the Evelyne III\
    \ PM in \xC9toupe Clemence leather (product code: H073967CK89) has been successfully\
    \ placed. This classic, understated crossbody is always a customer favorite, and\
    \ I have no doubt you\u2019ll find it just as versatile and elegant as our other\
    \ clients do. Your order is currently being prepared for shipment, and you\u2019\
    ll receive a tracking update as soon as it\u2019s on its way.\n\nTo answer your\
    \ question about the Evelyne\u2019s strap: yes, it is fully adjustable, so you\
    \ can wear it comfortably as a crossbody or over the shoulder. The canvas strap\
    \ is both sturdy and soft, designed for all-day use. You also asked about storage\u2014\
    the Evelyne III PM features a spacious main compartment and a convenient exterior\
    \ slip pocket.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a gift or looking to expand your\
    \ collection, I\u2019d also recommend the Picotin Lock 18 in Gold\u2014another\
    \ chic and practical choice for daily wear. Many of our clients love pairing their\
    \ Evelyne with a Twilly scarf or a Rodeo bag charm for a personalized touch. Let\
    \ me know if you\u2019d like suggestions on color combinations or would like to\
    \ add any accessories to your order.\n\nYour total comes to \u20AC2,700.00, and\
    \ as a thank you for your loyalty, we\u2019ve applied a complimentary express\
    \ shipping upgrade. If you have any other questions or would like to explore more\
    \ from this season\u2019s collection, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\
    \ I\u2019m here to help make your Hermes experience as seamless and enjoyable\
    \ as possible.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
