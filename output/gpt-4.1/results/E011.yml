  response_body: "Dear Sophia,\n\nThank you so much for your enthusiastic email! I\
    \ can absolutely sense your excitement about our new silk scarf collection\u2014\
    so many of our clients are feeling the same way this season, and it's wonderful\
    \ to see your keen eye for style.\n\nYour order for the \"Jardin d'Hiver\" silk\
    \ scarf (Product Code: HSC102) has been successfully created. This design is a\
    \ true standout with its delicate floral pattern and hand-rolled edges, and I\u2019\
    m sure it will add a touch of elegance to any outfit. Your order totals $495,\
    \ with our complimentary spring promotion already applied. We are preparing your\
    \ item for dispatch, and you will receive a shipping confirmation shortly.\n\n\
    You asked about care instructions for silk scarves. The best way to keep your\
    \ scarf looking divine is to hand wash gently in cool water or have it professionally\
    \ dry cleaned. Always store it flat and avoid direct sunlight to preserve those\
    \ vibrant colors.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to complement your new scarf, I\u2019\
    d recommend our leather glove collection or the signature enamel bangles\u2014\
    both are customer favorites and pair beautifully with silk accessories. Let me\
    \ know if you\u2019d like more details or styling suggestions!\n\nIf you need\
    \ your order by a specific date, just reply to this email and I\u2019ll be happy\
    \ to explore expedited options for you.\n\nThank you again for choosing Hermes,\
    \ Sophia. It\u2019s always a pleasure to help you find those extra-special pieces.\n\
    \nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
