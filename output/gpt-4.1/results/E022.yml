  response_body: "Dear Sophia,\n\nThank you so much for your enthusiastic message!\
    \ I'm delighted to confirm your recent order and share some extra details on the\
    \ products you asked about.\n\nYour order for the Kelly Mini handbag in Rouge\
    \ Casaque has been successfully placed. This iconic bag is a favorite for a reason\u2014\
    its vibrant color and petite silhouette make it both striking and versatile. Your\
    \ order total comes to $7,800, which includes a special seasonal promotion, so\
    \ you've secured a wonderful deal. The current status is \"created,\" and we'll\
    \ keep you updated every step of the way until it's on its way to you.\n\nYou\
    \ also asked about the difference between Epsom and Swift leather. Epsom leather\
    \ offers a structured, lightweight feel and is known for its durability and resistance\
    \ to scratches\u2014perfect if you want a bag that keeps its shape over time.\
    \ Swift, on the other hand, feels incredibly soft to the touch and has a slight\
    \ sheen, which gives the color a beautiful depth. If you love a vibrant, slightly\
    \ slouchy look, Swift is a fantastic choice!\n\nSince you mentioned loving bright\
    \ accessories, I think you\u2019d enjoy our matching Rodeo bag charms and the\
    \ silk Twilly scarves\u2014both are perfect for adding a playful touch to your\
    \ new handbag. These pieces sell out quickly, especially in bold colors to match\
    \ your new Kelly.\n\nIf you need a hand choosing between leathers or want a closer\
    \ look at other color options, just let me know. I'm here to help you find the\
    \ perfect match for your style.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
