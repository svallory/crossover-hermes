  response_body: "Dear Alexandra,\n\nThank you so much for your email and for choosing\
    \ Hermes once again! I\u2019m thrilled to help you with your order and questions\
    \ about our latest scarves.\n\nFirst, I\u2019m happy to confirm that your order\
    \ for the \"Les Jardins d\u2019Hiver\" silk scarf (product code SCF-2391) has\
    \ been successfully placed. We\u2019ve reserved one in the Rouge/Or colorway just\
    \ for you. Your order total comes to $495, with a $50 savings thanks to your loyalty\
    \ discount\u2014always a pleasure to reward our returning customers! We\u2019\
    ll update you as soon as your order is shipped, and tracking information will\
    \ follow.\n\nYou asked about the care instructions for this scarf: it\u2019s best\
    \ to dry clean only, which helps preserve the rich silk texture and vibrant colors.\
    \ Many of our clients find that storing their scarf in the original Hermes box\
    \ keeps it looking pristine for years. If you\u2019re considering this as a gift,\
    \ we\u2019re delighted to offer complimentary gift wrapping\u2014just let me know\
    \ if you\u2019d like to add this touch.\n\nSince you were also interested in other\
    \ seasonal options, I thought you might love the \"Brise d\u2019Automne\" cashmere\
    \ blend scarf as a cozy alternative for the colder months. It features a beautiful\
    \ autumnal palette and is perfect for layering. For a classic pairing, our enamel\
    \ bangles in similar tones make a wonderful match with either scarf, and they\u2019\
    re a favorite among collectors.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions\
    \ or if you\u2019d like to add gift wrapping or a matching accessory to your order.\
