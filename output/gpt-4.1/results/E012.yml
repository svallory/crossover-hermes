  response_body: "Dear Ms. Taylor,\n\nThank you for your email and for choosing Herm\xE8\
    s. I\u2019m delighted to confirm that your order for the Kelly 25 Sellier in Vert\
    \ Jade Epsom leather has been successfully created. This exquisite piece (product\
    \ code: H073123CKAVJ) is truly a standout, celebrated for its timeless lines and\
    \ the elegance of its structured silhouette. You selected the gold hardware, which\
    \ beautifully complements the Vert Jade shade\u2014an inspired choice! Your total\
    \ comes to $10,500, and your order is currently being prepared for shipment. We\u2019\
    ll send you tracking details as soon as your bag is on its way.\n\nYou asked about\
    \ caring for Epsom leather and keeping the bag pristine. Epsom is loved for its\
    \ durability and resistance to scratches, so it\u2019s perfect for everyday elegance.\
    \ I recommend storing your Kelly in its dust bag when not in use and avoiding\
    \ prolonged exposure to sunlight or moisture. If you ever need a refresh, our\
    \ in-store spa services can help maintain its impeccable look.\n\nSince you mentioned\
    \ this purchase is for a special anniversary, we\u2019d be delighted to include\
    \ our signature gift wrapping at no extra charge. Please let me know if you\u2019\
    d like to add a personalized note as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering building\
    \ a collection, the Kelly wallet in matching Vert Jade or a Twilly scarf would\
    \ pair beautifully with your new bag\u2014both are customer favorites for special\
    \ gifts and personal flair.\n\nShould you have any further questions or if you\u2019\
    d like recommendations on how to style your Kelly for different occasions, I\u2019\

  message: Hey, hope you're doing well. Last year for my birthday, my wife Emily got
    me a really nice leather briefcase from your store. I loved it and used it every
    day for work until the strap broke a few months ago. Speaking of broken things,
    I also need to get my lawnmower fixed before spring. Anyway, what were some of
    the other messenger bag or briefcase style options you have? I could go for something
    slightly smaller than my previous one. Oh and we also need to make dinner reservations
    for our anniversary next month. Maybe a nice Italian place downtown. What was
    I saying again? Oh right, work bags! Let me know what you'd recommend. Thanks!
