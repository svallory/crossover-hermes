  response_body: "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing your story about\
    \ the leather briefcase Emily gifted you last year. It\u2019s wonderful to hear\
    \ how much you enjoyed using it every day for work, though I\u2019m sorry to hear\
    \ about the strap breaking\u2014that\u2019s never what we want for our products.\n\
    \nYou asked about other messenger bag or briefcase style options, especially something\
    \ a bit smaller than your previous briefcase. At the moment, I don\u2019t have\
    \ specific product details to share, but I\u2019d be more than happy to help you\
    \ find the perfect replacement. If you have any preferences for color, material,\
    \ or features (like extra pockets or a laptop sleeve), just let me know, and I\u2019\
    ll make sure to recommend options that fit your needs.\n\nIf you\u2019d like,\
    \ I can also check if we have any new arrivals or styles that might suit your\
    \ work routine. Please let me know what you\u2019re looking for, and I\u2019ll\
    \ get back to you with tailored suggestions as soon as possible.\n\nThank you\
    \ again for your loyalty to Hermes. I\u2019m here to help you find a bag you\u2019\
    ll love just as much as the last one.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine\
