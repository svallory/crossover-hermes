  response_body: "Dear Ms. Laurent,\n\nThank you so much for your wonderful message.\
    \ I can feel your excitement about the Birkin bag, and it\u2019s truly contagious!\
    \ The Etoupe Clemence Birkin 30 you selected is an absolute icon, and I\u2019\
    m thrilled to confirm your order has been successfully created. Your order includes:\n\
    \n- Birkin 30 in Etoupe Clemence leather, with palladium hardware\n- Quantity:\
    \ 1\n- Price: \u20AC8,700\n\nYour total comes to \u20AC8,700, and we have secured\
    \ this piece for you. The bag is in stock and will be prepared for shipment shortly.\
    \ We\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the way, and you\u2019ll receive a\
    \ tracking link as soon as your Birkin is on its way.\n\nYou had a great question\
    \ about the difference between Clemence and Togo leather. Clemence is known for\
    \ its softer, more relaxed feel and slightly larger grain, giving the bag an effortlessly\
    \ elegant look. Togo is a bit more structured with finer grain and slightly more\
    \ scratch resistance\u2014both are exceptional, but Clemence offers that beautiful\
    \ slouchy silhouette over time.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering accessories, many\
    \ clients love pairing their Birkin with a playful Twilly scarf wrapped around\
    \ the handles or a Rodeo bag charm for a pop of color. We have several options\
    \ available and would be happy to recommend a few based on your style.\n\nIf this\
    \ Birkin is meant for a special occasion or as a gift, we also offer complimentary\
    \ gift wrapping\u2014just let us know your preference!\n\nShould you have any\
    \ questions about caring for Clemence leather or wish to explore additional accessories,\
    \ I\u2019m here to help. Thank you again for choosing Hermes for such a special\
    \ purchase.\n\nBest regards,\nHermes - Delivering divine fashion"
