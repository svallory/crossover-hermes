I’m happy to confirm your order for the Evelyne III PM bag in Etoupe Clemence leather (1 piece) and the Silk Twilly scarf in Orange/Vert (1 piece). Both items are in stock and reserved just for you. Your total comes to $5,400, which already includes your member discount – always a pleasure to recognize your loyalty as a valued Hermes client.

As soon as your bag is ready for dispatch, we’ll send you an update with tracking details and delivery information.

Since you asked about the dimensions and care, the Kelly 28 measures 28cm x 22cm x 10cm, making it perfect for essentials while maintaining that iconic, structured shape. The Togo leather is known for its durability and soft pebble texture, and it’s designed to age beautifully with proper care. We recommend storing your Kelly in its dust bag away from direct sunlight and using a gentle leather conditioner occasionally to keep it looking its best.

If you’re considering a matching accessory, the Kelly wallet in Noir with gold hardware is a stunning complement and fits seamlessly inside the Kelly 28. Many of our clients also love pairing their bags with a silk Twilly for a splash of colour and added protection to the handle.

E014,"Dear Olivia,

Thank you for your email and for choosing Hermes – it's always a pleasure to assist you! I’m delighted to confirm that your order for the Kelly 25 Bag in Blue Nuit (product code: HMBG-2531) has been successfully placed. This iconic piece is currently in stock and will be processed for shipment shortly. Your total comes to $9,800, which includes a promotional discount of $200 – I’m glad we could offer you a little something extra.

You asked whether the Kelly 25 fits a standard tablet. Great question! The Kelly 25 is designed for compact elegance, so while it holds essentials like your wallet, phone, and a small notebook, a standard tablet (larger than 8 inches) might be a tight squeeze. If you’re planning to carry tech on the go, you may want to consider our Garden Party Tote – it’s roomy, stylish, and perfect for work or travel.

Since you mentioned you love classic accessories, you might also like our matching Silk Twilly scarves – they’re perfect for adding a personal touch to your Kelly, or even as a chic wrist or hair accessory. Many of our customers pair their bags with these for a signature Hermes look.

E017,"Dear Ms. Laurent,

Thank you so much for your enthusiastic email—I can feel your excitement about the new season's collection, and it’s truly contagious! I’m delighted to confirm that your order for the Evelyne III PM in Étoupe Clemence leather (product code: H073967CK89) has been successfully placed. This classic, understated crossbody is always a customer favorite, and I have no doubt you’ll find it just as versatile and elegant as our other clients do. Your order is currently being prepared for shipment, and you’ll receive a tracking update as soon as it’s on its way.

To answer your question about the Evelyne’s strap: yes, it is fully adjustable, so you can wear it comfortably as a crossbody or over the shoulder. The canvas strap is both sturdy and soft, designed for all-day use. You also asked about storage—the Evelyne III PM features a spacious main compartment and a convenient exterior slip pocket.

If you’re considering a gift or looking to expand your collection, I’d also recommend the Picotin Lock 18 in Gold—another chic and practical choice for daily wear. Many of our clients love pairing their Evelyne with a Twilly scarf or a Rodeo bag charm for a personalized touch.

E018,"Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you so much for your wonderful email, and for choosing Hermes for your special gift. I can feel how much care you’re putting into this birthday surprise for your wife, and I’m delighted to help you make it memorable!

I’m pleased to confirm your order for the Kelly 25 in Etoupe Swift leather (Product Code: H-KLY25-ETP), with a palladium clasp. The order has been created successfully, and your total comes to $9,800. We’ve applied your VIP loyalty discount, so you’re also enjoying $500 in savings on this purchase. The bag is currently in stock and will be prepared for shipment shortly. You’ll receive tracking details as soon as it leaves our boutique. If you’d like, we can include our signature Hermes gift wrapping—just let me know!

You asked about the care requirements for Swift leather. Swift is renowned for its smooth, supple finish and vibrant color. It’s lightweight and soft to the touch, making it a favorite for those who appreciate subtle luxury. I recommend storing it in its dust bag when not in use and avoiding direct contact with water or oils. If you’d like, we offer a specialized Hermes leather care kit that pairs perfectly with Swift leather items—many of our clients find it invaluable for keeping their bags pristine.

Since this is for your wife’s birthday, may I also suggest a few complementary pieces? Our Twilly silk scarves add a beautiful, personalized touch to the Kelly handles, and we have several new patterns this season. A matching Bastia coin purse in Etoupe Swift is also available, which makes for a charming gift set.

If you have any other questions, or if you’d like to add gift wrapping or a personalized card to your order, just reply to this email and I’ll take care of everything.

Thank you again for trusting Hermes with such a meaningful gift. I’m here for anything you need!

E019,"Dear Ms. Thompson,

Thank you so much for your lovely email and for choosing Hermes—it's always a pleasure to assist someone with such a keen eye for style!

I'm thrilled to confirm that your order for the Kelly 25 Bag in Rouge Casaque has been successfully placed. This iconic piece is truly a statement of elegance and sophistication, and I'm confident you'll adore the vibrant hue and the supple Togo leather. Your total comes to $8,900, and as a token of our appreciation, we've applied a complimentary silk twilly scarf to your order—perfect for adding a personal touch to your new bag. 

You also asked about care instructions for the Kelly bag. It's best to store it in its dust bag, away from direct sunlight, and avoid contact with water or oils. For everyday cleaning, a soft, dry cloth works wonders. If you ever need a deeper clean, our in-house specialists are always here to help.

Since you mentioned this is for a special anniversary, may I suggest our Kelly wallet in matching Rouge Casaque or a delicate charm that complements your new bag beautifully? Both would make lovely additions, whether as a set or as a thoughtful gift. Gift wrapping is complimentary—we'd be delighted to help make this occasion even more special.

Your order is currently being prepared for shipment, and you'll receive tracking details as soon as it's on its way. If there's anything you need in the meantime—styling tips, care advice, or additional accessories—please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you again for choosing Hermes to celebrate your special moment. We look forward to delighting you soon!

Best regards,

E022,"Dear Sophia,

Thank you so much for your enthusiastic message! I'm delighted to confirm your recent order and share some extra details on the products you asked about.

Your order for the Kelly Mini handbag in Rouge Casaque has been successfully placed. This iconic bag is a favorite for a reason—its vibrant color and petite silhouette make it both striking and versatile. Your order total comes to $7,800, which includes a special seasonal promotion, so you've secured a wonderful deal. The current status is ""created,"" and we'll keep you updated every step of the way until it's on its way to you.

You also asked about the difference between Epsom and Swift leather. Epsom leather offers a structured, lightweight feel and is known for its durability and resistance to scratches—perfect if you want a bag that keeps its shape over time. Swift, on the other hand, feels incredibly soft to the touch and has a slight sheen, which gives the color a beautiful depth. If you love a vibrant, slightly slouchy look, Swift is a fantastic choice!

Since you mentioned loving bright accessories, I think you’d enjoy our matching Rodeo bag charms and the silk Twilly scarves—both are perfect for adding a playful touch to your new handbag. These pieces sell out quickly, especially in bold colors to match your new Kelly.

If you need a hand choosing between leathers or want a closer look at other color options, just let me know. I'm here to help you find the perfect match for your style.

Best regards,
