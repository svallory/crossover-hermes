## Inquiry Responder Agent

This module implements the Inquiry Responder Agent for the Hermes system.
This agent is activated when an email is classified as a "product_inquiry".
Its main responsibilities are:

1.  **Understanding Customer Questions**: Parses the `EmailAnalysis` to identify explicit
    and implicit questions asked by the customer, along with any products they referenced.
2.  **Information Retrieval (RAG)**: Utilizes product catalog tools, especially
    `search_products_by_description` (the RAG tool using the vector store), to find
    products and information relevant to the customer's query. It may also use
    `find_product_by_id` or `find_product_by_name` for specific references.
3.  **Answer Synthesis**: Uses an LLM (guided by `inquiry_responder_prompt`) to synthesize
    the retrieved product information and the customer's questions into coherent answers.
4.  **Identifying Related Products**: May suggest related or alternative products based on
    the context of the inquiry and the retrieved information.
5.  **Result Compilation**: Structures all findings (answers, primary products, related
    products, key response points) into an `InquiryResponse` Pydantic model.
6.  **Verification**: The `InquiryResponse` may undergo a verification step to ensure accuracy
    and completeness.

This agent acts as a knowledgeable product specialist, leveraging the catalog and RAG
capabilities to address customer inquiries effectively.

### Agent Implementation Notes:

- **Pydantic Models**: Defines `ProductInformation`, `QuestionAnswer`, and `InquiryResponse` for structuring the data this agent works with and produces.
- **Agent Node Function (`process_inquiry_node`)**:
    - Retrieves `EmailAnalysis` from state.
    - **Question/Focus Extraction**: Placeholder logic to determine what the customer is asking about. A real version might involve a more nuanced interpretation of `EmailAnalysis.product_references` and `EmailAnalysis.customer_signals`, or even an LLM call if questions are very implicit.
    - **RAG Tool Call (Mocked)**: Simulates a call to a RAG tool (like `vector_store.similarity_search`). This is a critical step where the agent fetches relevant product documents from the vector store based on the inquiry.
        - The `query_for_rag` is derived from the email analysis. The quality of this query significantly impacts RAG performance.
    - **LLM for Synthesis (Mocked)**: After RAG, an LLM (using `inquiry_responder_prompt`) is supposed to synthesize the retrieved information and the customer's questions into the `InquiryResponse` structure. This is also mocked.
    - **Output**: Returns a dictionary `{"inquiry_result": ...}` to update the LangGraph state.
- **Mock Logic**: Like other agents, this contains significant mock logic for RAG calls and LLM synthesis. **These must be replaced with actual tool/LLM invocations.**
- **Dependencies**: This agent relies heavily on:
    - The `EmailAnalysis` output.
    - Access to RAG tools (which in turn depend on the `VectorStoreInterface` and `product_catalog_df`).
    - An LLM and the `inquiry_responder_prompt`.
- **Verification (Placeholder)**: A verification step for the `InquiryResponse` is mentioned in `reference-agent-flow.md` and would be important for quality control.

This agent forms the heart of the RAG process for handling product questions, combining information retrieval with intelligent synthesis.
