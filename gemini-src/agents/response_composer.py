## Response Composer Agent

This module implements the Response Composer Agent for the Hermes system.
This is the final agent in the workflow, responsible for generating the actual email
response that will be sent to the customer.

**Core Responsibilities**:

1.  **Information Synthesis**: Consolidates all information gathered by previous agents:
    -   `EmailAnalysis`: Provides context about the customer's original email (classification,
        tone, language, product references, detected customer signals).
    -   `OrderProcessingResult` (if applicable): Contains details about processed order items,
        stock status, fulfilled items, out-of-stock items, and suggested alternatives.
    -   `InquiryResponse` (if applicable): Includes answers to customer questions, details
        about discussed products, and related suggestions.
2.  **Response Generation**: Uses an LLM, guided by the `response_composer_prompt`, to craft
    a coherent, natural-sounding, and contextually appropriate email response.
3.  **Tone and Style Adaptation**: Critically, this agent must adapt its language, tone,
    and formality to match the customer's original communication style (as indicated in
    `EmailAnalysis`) and incorporate empathetic responses to customer signals (following
    guidelines from `customer-signal-processing.md`).
4.  **Completeness and Clarity**: Ensures the response addresses all necessary points from
    the preceding processing steps in a clear and understandable manner.
5.  **Natural Language**: Focuses on generating human-like text, avoiding robotic or
    overly templated phrasing.

**Output**:
The agent's primary output is the `final_response` (a string), which is the full text
of the email to be sent to the customer.

**Verification**:
A verification step (as mentioned in `reference-agent-flow.md`) should ideally be applied
to the generated response to check for quality, tone appropriateness, completeness,
and absence of templated language before finalizing.

### Agent Implementation Notes:

- **Agent Node Function (`compose_response_node`)**:
    - Retrieves `email_analysis`, `order_result` (if any), and `inquiry_result` (if any) from the state.
    - **Input Preparation**: It formats these potentially complex objects into JSON strings as expected by the `response_composer_prompt`.
    - **LLM Invocation (Mocked)**: The core of this agent is an LLM call using the `response_composer_prompt`. This call synthesizes all the input information into the final email text. This is currently mocked.
    - **Output**: Returns a dictionary `{"final_response": final_email_text}` to update the state.
- **No Internal Pydantic Model for Output**: Unlike other agents that produce structured Pydantic models, this agent's primary output is the final response string. An intermediate `ResponseComposition` Pydantic model (as hinted in `reference-agent-flow.md`) *could* be used internally if the composition process itself were a multi-step LLM interaction (e.g., first plan the response sections, then generate text for each), but for a single generation step, it's not strictly necessary for the agent's *final* output.
- **Mock Logic**: The response generation is heavily mocked. **The actual LLM call using `response_composer_prompt` is critical and needs to be implemented.**
- **Dependencies**: This agent depends on:
    - Outputs from all previous agents (`EmailAnalysis`, `OrderProcessingResult`, `InquiryResponse`).
    - An LLM and the `response_composer_prompt`.
    - Effective customer signal processing guidelines from `customer-signal-processing.md` being well-integrated into the prompt.
- **Verification (Placeholder)**: `reference-agent-flow.md` suggests a `verify_response_quality` step. This would be essential to ensure the generated email is appropriate, complete, and adheres to tone guidelines before being considered final. This could involve another LLM call or heuristic checks.
- **Temperature Setting**: It's noted that the LLM temperature for this creative generation task might be different (potentially higher) than for more analytical tasks in other agents.

This agent is where all the preceding analysis and processing culminate into the actual communication with the customer.
