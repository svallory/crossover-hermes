## Response Generation Tools

This module contains tools focused on natural language processing and response generation tasks.
These tools assist agents in understanding customer communication (tone, questions) and in
crafting appropriate, human-like responses.

Key functionalities include:
- Analyzing the tone and formality of customer text.
- Extracting explicit and implicit questions from customer messages.
- Generating a complete, natural language response based on a structured composition plan,
  which might include information gathered by other agents and tools.

These tools will typically leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for their core logic.
Access to an LLM client/instance will be necessary for their full implementation.
They are designed for use by LangChain agents.

### Tool Implementation Notes:

- **LLM Dependence**: Tools like `analyze_tone`, `extract_questions`, and especially `generate_natural_response` are heavily reliant on LLM calls for their core logic. The placeholders here use simple keyword matching or mock outputs. Real implementations would involve constructing appropriate prompts and invoking an LLM (e.g., via an `llm_client` passed in or accessed from config).
- **Integration with Agents**: 
    - `analyze_tone` and `extract_questions`: As noted, these might be subsumed into the Email Analyzer agent's direct output generation. If they remain tools, they'd be called by that agent.
    - `generate_natural_response`: This is conceptually the main task of the Response Composer agent. If it's a tool, the agent's logic would be to first create the `ResponseCompositionPlan` and then call this tool. Alternatively, the agent itself directly makes the final LLM call using a dynamically constructed prompt based on its inputs (analysis, order/inquiry results, signals).
- **`llm_client` Injection**: The `generate_natural_response` tool shows an `llm_client` argument. This highlights the need for tools that make direct LLM calls to have access to the configured LLM client. This dependency would need to be managed by the agent execution framework.
