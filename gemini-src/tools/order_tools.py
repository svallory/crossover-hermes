## Order and Inventory Tools

This module provides tools for managing product inventory and processing aspects of customer orders.
These tools are crucial for agents responsible for handling order requests, verifying stock availability,
updating inventory levels, and extracting order-related details like promotions.

Key functionalities include:
- Checking the current stock level of a specific product.
- Updating the stock level after an order is processed or inventory changes.
- Finding alternative products if a requested item is out of stock.
- Extracting promotional information from product descriptions, which can be used in customer responses.

Like other tool modules, these functions are decorated with `@tool` for LangChain agent compatibility.
They will require access to inventory data (e.g., a pandas DataFrame or a database) and potentially
product data for promotion extraction. These dependencies will be managed in their full implementations.

### Tool Implementation Notes:

- **Stock Management**: The `update_stock` tool currently has a placeholder for how it would modify the DataFrame. In a real system, if a pandas DataFrame is used as the single source of truth for stock that needs to be updated across multiple email processing instances, proper state management or a database backend would be critical to avoid race conditions and ensure data integrity. For this assignment, modifying a DataFrame in-memory per email processing run might be acceptable if the context is a sequential batch process.
- **Alternative Finding**: `find_alternatives_for_oos` is a key tool for customer experience. A robust implementation would combine category matching with semantic similarity (if a vector store is available and populated with product data) and potentially business rules (e.g., price range similarity).
- **Promotion Extraction**: `extract_promotion` is simplified. A more advanced version could use an LLM call with a specific prompt to parse varied promotional texts into a structured format, or use more complex regex patterns. The `reference-agent-flow.md` suggests LLM-based extraction for this.
- **Dependencies**: These tools rely on having access to `product_catalog_df` (which includes product details and stock) and potentially a `vector_store`. These would be passed into the tools when they are invoked by an agent.
