# Tools for Hermes Agents

This section outlines the tools available to the agents within the Hermes email processing system. Tools are essential components that enable agents to interact with external systems, data sources, or perform specific, well-defined tasks that don't require direct LLM reasoning for every step.

## Purpose of Tools

In an LLM-powered agentic system, tools serve several key purposes:

1.  **Access to External Data**: Tools allow agents to fetch real-time information that is not part of their training data or the current prompt context. For Hermes, this primarily involves accessing the product catalog and inventory data.
2.  **Performing Actions**: Agents can use tools to execute actions, such as updating inventory levels or recording order details.
3.  **Structured Operations**: For tasks that are deterministic and rule-based (e.g., looking up a product by its exact ID), tools provide a more reliable and efficient mechanism than relying on LLM generation.
4.  **Reducing LLM Load**: Offloading specific tasks to tools can reduce the complexity of prompts and the cognitive load on the LLM, potentially leading to faster and more accurate results.
5.  **Modularity and Reusability**: Tools are implemented as distinct functions, making them reusable across different agents or even different applications.

## Tool Implementation Strategy

For the Hermes reference solution, tools are implemented as Python functions and are made available to LangChain agents using the `@tool` decorator from `langchain_core.tools`.

Key aspects of our tool implementation strategy include:

-   **Clear Naming and Docstrings**: Each tool has a descriptive name and a detailed docstring. The docstring is crucial as it's what the LLM uses to understand the tool's purpose, its arguments, and when to use it.
-   **Type Hinting**: All tool functions use Python type hints for arguments and return values. This helps with code clarity and can be leveraged by Pydantic for input validation if the tool is called with structured input.
-   **Pydantic Models for Complex I/O**: For tools that accept or return complex data structures, Pydantic models are used to define the schema. This ensures data integrity and makes it easier for the LLM to provide correctly formatted inputs and understand the outputs.
-   **Focused Functionality**: Each tool is designed to perform a single, well-defined task.
-   **Error Handling**: Tools should include basic error handling (e.g., what to do if a product ID is not found) and return informative error messages or states that the agent can then process.
-   **Dependency Injection**: Tools can receive necessary dependencies, like a database connection or the `HermesConfig` object, through mechanisms like `InjectedToolArg` or by being instantiated within a class that holds these dependencies.

## Organization of Tools

Tools are organized into modules within the `src/tools/` directory based on their primary area of responsibility:

-   `catalog_tools.py`: Contains tools for interacting with the product catalog. This includes searching for products by ID, name, or description (semantic search via RAG), and finding related or alternative products.
-   `order_tools.py`: Provides tools for order processing and inventory management. This includes checking stock levels, updating stock, creating order entries, and extracting promotion details.
-   `response_tools.py`: Includes utilities that might assist in analyzing customer communication or structuring parts of the response, such as tone analysis or question extraction. Some of these functionalities might also be directly embedded within agent logic if they are tightly coupled with LLM calls.

This modular organization helps in keeping the codebase clean and makes it easier to manage and extend the available tools as the system evolves.

The subsequent files in this directory will detail the implementation of these specific tools.
