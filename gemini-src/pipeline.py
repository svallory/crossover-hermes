### Hermes Processing Pipeline Definition

This module defines the core processing pipeline for the Hermes email system using LangGraph.
It orchestrates the flow of execution between the different specialized agents:

1.  **Email Analyzer**: Analyzes the incoming email.
2.  **Conditional Routing**: Directs the flow based on the classification ("order_request" or "product_inquiry").
3.  **Order Processor**: Handles order requests.
4.  **Inquiry Responder**: Handles product inquiries.
5.  **Response Composer**: Generates the final response after either the order or inquiry path is complete.

**Implementation Details:**

-   Uses `langgraph.graph.StateGraph` to define the workflow.
-   The state schema is imported from `src.state.HermesState`.
-   Agent node functions (`analyze_email_node`, `order_processor_agent_node`, etc.) are imported from `src.agents`.
-   A conditional routing function (`route_by_classification`) determines the path after the initial analysis.
-   The final compiled graph (`hermes_workflow`) represents the complete, executable pipeline.

### Notes on Pipeline Implementation:

-   **StateGraph**: The core is `langgraph.graph.StateGraph`, initialized with the `HermesState` TypedDict.
-   **Nodes**: Each primary agent function (`analyze_email_node`, `order_processor_agent_node`, `inquiry_responder_agent_node`, `response_composer_agent_node`) is added as a node to the graph using `workflow.add_node()`.
    -   **Dependency Injection**: Note that the node functions require dependencies like `llm`, `config`, `tools`, `vector_store`, `prompts`. These dependencies are *not* passed during graph definition (`add_node`). They need to be injected when the graph is *executed* or compiled with context. This is often done using `functools.partial` or by passing them via the `RunnableConfig` when invoking the compiled graph.
-   **Entry Point**: `workflow.set_entry_point(NODE_EMAIL_ANALYZER)` defines where the execution begins.
-   **Conditional Routing**: `workflow.add_conditional_edges(...)` is used after the `Email Analyzer`. It calls the `route_by_classification` function, which inspects the state (`email_analysis_output.classification`) and returns the name of the next node (`NODE_ORDER_PROCESSOR` or `NODE_INQUIRY_RESPONDER`). The dictionary maps the return value of the routing function to the target node name. Includes a fallback route directly to the composer for unexpected classifications or errors.
-   **Linear Edges**: `workflow.add_edge(...)` defines the standard flow after the order/inquiry processing branches â€“ both lead to the `Response Composer`.
-   **End**: The final edge connects the `Response Composer` to the special `END` node, signifying the completion of the workflow for that input.
-   **Compilation**: The graph definition (`StateGraph`) is compiled into an executable `CompiledGraph` using `workflow.compile()`. This step often includes setting up a `checkpointer` (like `MemorySaver`) if state persistence or resumption is needed.
-   **Placeholders**: This file currently uses placeholder imports and dummy agent node functions. **These must be replaced with the actual imports from `src.state` and `src.agents` once those modules are correctly placed and structured within the project.**

This structure defines the complete control flow for processing an email through the Hermes multi-agent system.
