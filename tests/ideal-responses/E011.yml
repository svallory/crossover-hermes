    Hi there,

    Thanks for your question about our RSG8901 Retro Sunglasses and their style inspiration!

    You're right, they do offer a cool, nostalgic vibe. While they are broadly vintage-inspired,
    the design doesn't pinpoint a specific decade like the 1950s or 1960s. Instead,
    they aim to capture a general retro aesthetic that can be appreciated by fans
    of various vintage styles.

    We hope this helps clarify the inspiration behind them!

    Thank you,

    Hermes - Delivering divine fashion
