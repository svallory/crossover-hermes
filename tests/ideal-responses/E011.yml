      Hi there,

      Thanks for your question about our RSG8901 Retro Sunglasses and their style inspiration!

      You're right, they do offer a cool, nostalgic vibe. While they are broadly vintage-inspired, the design doesn't pinpoint a specific decade like the 1950s or 1960s. Instead, they aim to capture a general retro aesthetic that can be appreciated by fans of various vintage styles.

      We hope this helps clarify the inspiration behind them!

      Thank you,
