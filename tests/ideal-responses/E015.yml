  message: "Hi team, I recently purchased the Tailored Suit (TLR5432) and overall, I'm very impressed with the quality and fit for the price! The wool feels great. My only small feedback is that the trouser legs are a little wider at the ankle than I typically prefer for a modern suit. Is any tailoring service or recommendation available through you for slight alterations, like tapering the trousers? Not a dealbreaker at all, still love the suit! Best, Michael P."

      Hi Michael,

      Thank you so much for your feedback on the TLR5432 Tailored Suit! We're delighted to hear that you're impressed with the quality, fit, and the feel of the wool – that's fantastic!

      We also appreciate your note about the trouser leg width at the ankle. While we don't currently offer an in-house tailoring service for alterations, tapering trousers is a common adjustment that a local professional tailor should be able to handle for you to achieve your preferred modern fit.

      We recommend searching for well-reviewed tailors in your area; they would be best equipped to assist with this.

      Thanks again for choosing Hermes and for sharing your thoughts. We're glad you love the suit!

      Best regards,
      Hermes - Delivering divine fashion
