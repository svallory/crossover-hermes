E012,"Dear Emily,

Thank you for your thoughtful message and for sharing your wonderful experience with our leather briefcase. We’re delighted to hear how much you enjoyed it, and we truly appreciate your continued interest in Hermes. 

I understand you’re looking for messenger bag or briefcase style options, ideally something slightly smaller than your previous one. While I don’t have the exact details of your past purchase, I’d be glad to recommend a curated selection of our newest, more compact messenger bags and briefcases that blend both style and practicality. 

Would you mind letting me know if you prefer classic leather, or are you interested in exploring other materials or color palettes? This will help me tailor my recommendations to your taste and needs. In the meantime, I will prepare a shortlist of our most popular options that align with what you described, and I’ll be happy to share product details, photos, and availability with you.

If you have any other preferences or questions, please let me know—I’m here to help you find your perfect everyday companion.

Best regards,
Hermes - Delivering divine fashion"
