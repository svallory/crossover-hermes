# Notebook Tool Failures

This file logs failures encountered while testing the `the-notebook-mcp` tools.

## `mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output`

- **Description:** This tool is supposed to read the output(s) of a specific code cell.
- **Initial Issue Reported:** The tool call consistently returned `"Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message."`
- **Revised Understanding:** It was correctly pointed out that a code cell must be *executed* for it to have any output to read. My previous tests attempted to read output from cells that were newly created or edited but never executed.
- **Current Limitation:** The available `the-notebook-mcp` toolset does not include a tool to execute notebook cells. Therefore, I cannot generate output within a cell and then use `mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output` to read it back.
- **Conclusion on this tool:** The "error" message was likely a consequence of there being no output to read from the non-executed cells. A proper test of this tool would require either a notebook with pre-existing outputs or a tool to execute cells.

- **Original Call Attempts (for historical record):**
  - **First Call Sent:**
    ```json
  {
    "tool_name": "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output",
    "parameters": {
      "cell_index": 0,
      "notebook_path": "/work/crossover/hermes/notebooks/the-notebook-mcp-test.ipynb"
    }
  }
  ```
  - **First Response Received:**
    ```json
  {
    "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output_response": {
      "results": ["Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message."]
    }
  }
  ```
  - **Second Call Sent (after user typed "continue"):**
    ```json
  {
    "tool_name": "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output",
    "parameters": {
      "cell_index": 0,
      "notebook_path": "/work/crossover/hermes/notebooks/the-notebook-mcp-test.ipynb"
    }
  }
  ```
  - **Second Response Received:**
    ```json
  {
    "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output_response": {
      "results": ["Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message."]
    }
  }
  ```
  - **Third Call Sent (after I decided to log and continue):**
    ```json
  {
    "tool_name": "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output",
    "parameters": {
      "cell_index": 0,
      "notebook_path": "/work/crossover/hermes/notebooks/the-notebook-mcp-test.ipynb"
    }
  }
  ```
  - **Third Response Received:**
    ```json
  {
    "mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_read_cell_output_response": {
      "results": ["Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message."]
    }
  }
  ```

## Other Tool Notes:

*   **`mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_move_cell`**: When moving cell `0` to `1` in a 2-cell notebook, the tool reported no effective change. Moving cell `1` to `0` worked as expected. This might be an edge case or intended behavior for the `to_index` parameter.
    *   Call that showed no change: `mcp_the-notebook-mcp_notebook_move_cell(from_index = 0, notebook_path = "...", to_index = 1)`
    *   Result: `Cell at index 0 was not moved (source and destination are effectively the same).`

All other tools appeared to function correctly based on their responses. The test notebook `/work/crossover/hermes/notebooks/the-notebook-mcp-test.ipynb` (and its renamed version) was created, modified, and deleted successfully. The exported Python file `/work/crossover/hermes/notebooks/the-notebook-mcp-test.py` should also have been created and then left in place.
