# Hermes Model Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Model Consolidation:**
   - Merged `OrderItem` (TypedDict) and `OrderedItem` into the unified `OrderLine` Pydantic model
   - Merged `ProcessedOrder` and `Order` into a single comprehensive `Order` Pydantic model
   - Renamed `OrderedItemStatus` to `OrderLineStatus` for consistency

2. **Common Error Handling:**
   - Created a dedicated `errors.py` module with the standardized `ProductNotFound` model
   - Removed duplicate error class definitions across tools

3. **Tool Interface Standardization:**
   - Updated all tool functions to accept JSON string inputs via the `tool_input` parameter
   - Implemented proper JSON parsing and error handling for all tools
   - Fixed broken `find_alternatives_for_oos` function with a simpler implementation

4. **Pydantic Model Usage:**
   - Standardized on Pydantic models throughout the codebase
   - Added proper model instantiation in place of dictionary creation
   - Fixed attribute access to use proper model attributes instead of dictionary access

5. **Type Safety Improvements:**
   - Fixed type issues in the promotion handling code
   - Ensured consistent return types across the system
   - Improved error handling with appropriate fallbacks

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Model Complexity:**
   - Fewer models to maintain and understand
   - Clearer relationships between entities
   - Better encapsulation of order processing logic

2. **Improved Type Safety:**
   - Consistent use of Pydantic models with validation
   - Better editor support and autocomplete
   - Fewer runtime errors due to type mismatches

3. **Enhanced Maintainability:**
   - Standardized tool interfaces
   - Better error handling and reporting
   - Explicit data flow between components

4. **Fixed Bugs:**
   - Resolved issues with dictionary vs. object access
   - Implemented missing functionality
   - Corrected inconsistent model usage

## Next Steps

1. Update tests to use the new model structure
2. Update prompts to align with the new model field names
3. Update documentation to reflect the simplified model hierarchy
