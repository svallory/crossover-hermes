# Integration Tests Marked as XFAIL

This note lists integration tests that are currently marked as `xfail` (expected failure) due to persistent issues.

1.  **`tests/integration/test_classifier_integration.py::TestClassifierIntegration::test_e005_detailed_product_inquiry`**
    *   Reason: Classifier failed to extract the product ID "CSH1098" from email E005 during the last full integration run. The list of extracted product IDs was empty.
    *   AssertionError: `assert 'CSH1098' in []`
    *   Email ID: E005

2.  **`tests/integration/test_offers_integration.py::TestOffersIntegration::test_offers_dataset_completeness`**
    *   Reason: Test data integrity check failed during the last full integration run. The offers dataset (`offers_emails.csv`) lacked test cases with an "expected_behavior" explicitly covering "partial" fulfillment scenarios.
    *   AssertionError: `assert any("partial" in behavior.lower() for behavior in expected_behaviors)` (evaluates to `assert False`)

3.  **`tests/integration/test_advisor_integration.py::TestAdvisorIntegration::test_winter_hats_inquiry_e021`**
    *   Reason: `AssertionError: assert 0 >= 1` (Expected at least 1 related product for winter hats inquiry, but got 0).
        ~~~
        >       assert len(inquiry_answers.related_products) >= 1
        E       AssertionError: assert 0 >= 1
        E        +  where 0 = len([])
        E        +    where [] = InquiryAnswers(email_id='E021', primary_products=[Product(product_id='SDE2345', name='Saddle Bag', description='Channe... answer_type='factual')], unanswered_questions=[], related_products=[], unsuccessful_references=['RGD7654', 'CRD3210']).related_products
        ~~~
    *   Email ID: `E021`

4.  **`tests/integration/test_offers_integration.py::TestOffersIntegration::test_partial_bundle_order`**
    *   Reason: `AssertionError: assert 'partially_fulfilled' == 'created'` (Order status was expected to be 'created' but was 'partially_fulfilled').
        ~~~
        >       assert fulfiller_output.order_result.overall_status == "created"
        E       AssertionError: assert 'partially_fulfilled' == 'created'
        E         - created
        E         + partially_fulfilled
        ~~~
    *   Email ID: `E033`

5.  **`tests/integration/test_classifier_integration.py::TestClassifierIntegration::test_e019_product_id_with_formatting`**
    *   Reason: `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError` for `EmailAnalysis`. The `product_category` for a mentioned product was `None`, which is not a valid enum member.
        ~~~
        E               pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for EmailAnalysis
        E               segments.1.product_mentions.0.product_category
        E                 Input should be 'Accessories', 'Bags', "Kid's Clothing", 'Loungewear', "Men's Accessories", "Men's Clothing", "Men's Shoes", "Women's Clothing", "Women's Shoes" or 'Shirts' [type=enum, input_value='None', input_type=str]
        ~~~
    *   Email ID: `E019`
