# Unit Tests Checklist

## Original Instructions

- Review the test files to ensure they properly assert that the reference implementation fulfills requirements in:
  - [assignment-instructions.md](../../docs/assignment/assignment-instructions.md)
  - [assignment-q&a.md](../../docs/assignment/assignment-q&a.md)
  - [hidden-evaluation-criteria.md](../../docs/assignment/hidden-evaluation-criteria.md)
- The solution the tests are checking is defined in:
  - [customer-signal-processing.md](../../docs/assignment/solution/customer-signal-processing.md) 
  - [reference-agent-flow.md](../../docs/assignment/solution/reference-agent-flow.md) 
  - [reference-solution-spec.md](../../docs/assignment/solution/reference-solution-spec.md) 
  - [solution-guide.m](../../docs/assignment/solution/solution-guide.md)
- Iteratively run the tests and fix the issues (in them or the source code) until they pass

## Detailed Issue Analysis

### test_response_composer.py (1 error) - FIXED ✅
- **Issue**: `KeyError: 'email_id'` in `test_out_of_stock_response`
- **Root Cause**: The out-of-stock response composer was attempting to access a missing 'email_id' field in the state
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Enhanced email_id handling in compose_response_node to extract it from multiple sources
  - Ensured test fixtures include the email_id field
  - Updated assertions to match the mock response content

### test_order_processor.py (5 failures)
- **Issue 1**: `update_stock` not called when expected in multiple tests
  - **Tests Affected**: last_item_stock, complex_format, multiple_items
  - **Root Cause**: The order processor isn't properly updating inventory after successful order creation
  - **Fix Required**: Ensure that whenever an order status is "created", the update_stock function is called

- **Issue 2**: Incorrect item status in exceeds_stock test
  - **Root Cause**: Item status set to 'created' instead of 'out_of_stock' when order quantity exceeds available stock
  - **Fix Required**: Modify the order_processor to correctly set item status to 'out_of_stock' when requested quantity exceeds stock

- **Issue 3**: Promotion details assertion failure
  - **Test Affected**: promotion_detection
  - **Root Cause**: The order_processor isn't correctly applying or storing promotion details
  - **Fix Required**: Ensure proper extraction and application of promotion details in OrderItem objects

### test_pipeline.py (3 errors)
- **Issue 1**: API key invalidity
  - **Root Cause**: Mock API keys aren't properly configured for OpenAI in test environment
  - **Fix Required**: Update the mock_openai fixture to properly mock authentication
  
- **Issue 2**: Query parameter issues
  - **Root Cause**: Potential missing or incorrect parameters in pipeline flow
  - **Fix Required**: Review pipeline input state initialization to ensure all required parameters are included

## Implementation Action Items

1. **Fix Response Composer**: ✅
   - ✅ Add email_id field validation in compose_response_node function
   - ✅ Add default fallback value for email_id if missing
   - ✅ Review all test fixtures to ensure email_id is consistently included

2. **Fix Order Processor**:
   - Add stock update checks to ensure update_stock is called for all created orders
   - Fix status logic for out-of-stock items
   - Update promotion handling to correctly process and include promotion details
   - Add error handling for edge cases

3. **Fix Pipeline Tests**:
   - Update OpenAI mock configuration
   - Ensure all required query parameters are provided in test inputs
   - Add better error handling for API authentication issues

4. **Test Execution Order**:
   - ✅ First fix the most foundational issues in email_classifier and basic utils
   - ✅ Then fix response_composer issues
   - Next fix order_processor issues
   - Finally, fix pipeline integration tests

## Code Areas to Check

- src/agents/order_processor.py:
  - Check update_stock call logic
  - Verify item status determination
  - Review promotion application code

- src/agents/response_composer.py: ✅
  - Check email_id field usage
  - Review error handling for missing fields

- src/pipeline.py:
  - Check API authentication and initialization
  - Review state passing between pipeline stages

## Testing Strategy

1. Fix each component test in isolation
2. Run the unit tests individually to verify fixes
3. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Finally run integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality

## Requirements Coverage

The test suite comprehensively covers all the key requirements from the assignment documents:

### Key Hidden Evaluation Criteria Coverage:
1. ✅ Multi-Language Support (test_multi_language_email, test_multi_language_inquiry, test_multi_language_response)
2. ✅ Complex Product Reference Patterns (test_vague_reference_email, test_complex_format_reference)
3. ✅ Mixed Intent/Future Purchase Handling (test_mixed_intent_email)
4. ✅ Inventory Edge Cases (test_exceeds_stock, test_last_item_stock)
5. ✅ Email Metadata Inconsistencies (test_missing_subject_email)
6. ✅ Special Product Data Handling (test_promotion_detection, test_promotion_inclusion)
7. ✅ Seasonal/Occasion-Specific Inquiries (test_seasonal_inquiry, test_occasion_specific_inquiry)
8. ✅ Tone/Style Adaptation (implicitly tested in response generation tests)
9. ✅ Email Classification Complexity (tested throughout email_classifier tests)
10. ✅ Tangential Information Handling (test_tangential_info_email)

## Conclusion

The test suite is well designed and comprehensive, covering all requirements in the assignment documents. Currently working through fixing the failing tests:

1. ✅ test_email_classifier.py and test_basic.py pass successfully
2. ✅ test_response_composer.py now passes after fixing email_id handling
3. Still need to fix:
   - test_order_processor.py - missing stock updates, incorrect item status, promotion handling
   - test_pipeline.py - API key and parameter issues
