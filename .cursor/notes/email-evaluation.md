*   **E003**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" and extracts "LTH1098 Leather Backpack" and "Leather Tote".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves LTH1098. "Leather Tote" is correctly identified as an unresolved mention as it's too generic.
    *   Advisor: Correctly identifies unanswered questions about comparing the LTH1098 and a generic "Leather Tote", and about organizational pockets.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response providing information on LTH1098 and asking for clarification on the "Leather Tote".
*   **E004**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "SFT1098 Infinity Scarves" with quantity 3 (parsed from "three to four").
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves SFT1098. Initial stock: 8.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 3 SFT1098 (stock becomes 5).
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the order.
*   **E005**: Issue
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" and extracts "CSH1098 Cozy Shawl".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves CSH1098. Initial stock: 3.
    *   Advisor: States "Unable to process inquiry due to system error." This is incorrect. It should have answered the questions about material quality and suitability as a lap blanket based on the product description.
    *   Composer: Response is based on the incorrect Advisor output, apologizing for a system error.
*   **E006**: Issue
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" (customer states they will wait to order). Extracts "CBT8901 Chelsea Boots".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves CBT8901. Initial stock: 2.
    *   Advisor: States "Unable to process inquiry due to system error." This is incorrect. The customer isn't asking a specific question to be answered *now* but is stating an intent. The advisor should probably acknowledge the interest.
    *   Composer: Response is based on the incorrect Advisor output, apologizing for a system error.
*   **E007**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "5 CLF2109 Cable Knit Beanies" and "2 pairs of FZZ1098 Fuzzy Slippers".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves CLF2109 (Initial stock: 2) and FZZ1098 (Initial stock: 2).
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 2 FZZ1098 (stock becomes 0). Correctly identifies CLF2109 as "out of stock" for the requested quantity of 5, as only 2 are available. Stock for CLF2109 remains 2 as the order line is not created.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the FZZ1098 order and informing about the CLF2109 stock issue, suggesting alternatives.
*   **E008**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "Versatile Scarves" with description.

    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 1 VSC6789 (stock becomes 5).
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the order.
*   **E009**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" in Spanish and extracts "DHN0987 Gorro de punto grueso". (Note: Product ID in CSV is CHN0987, but the system seems to handle this discrepancy, likely due to name/description matching).
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves to CHN0987 "Chunky Knit Beanie". Initial stock: 2.
    *   Advisor: Correctly answers questions about material ("thick, cozy yarn") and warmth for winter based on the product description.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response in Spanish answering the questions.
*   **E010**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "RSG8901 Retro Sunglasses".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves RSG8901. Initial stock: 1.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 1 RSG8901 (stock becomes 0).
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the order.
*   **E011**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" and extracts "RSG8901 Retro Sunglasses".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves RSG8901. Stock is now 0 from E010.
    *   Advisor: Correctly answers the question about the era, stating it's "vintage-inspired" based on the description.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response.
*   **E012**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry". Extracts mentions of "leather briefcase", "messenger bag", and "briefcase style options".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies all mentions as unresolved as they are too generic.
    *   Advisor: Correctly identifies the unanswered question about recommendations for messenger bags/briefcases.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response acknowledging the previous purchase, the broken strap, and explaining that more specific information is needed to provide recommendations, suggesting browsing the website or asking for personalized recommendations.
*   **E013**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "slide sandals for men" in "Men's Shoes category" for "summer".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies this as an unresolved mention. While SLD7654 "Slide Sandals" exist, the query is specific enough that without a direct match or very high semantic similarity, not resolving it is acceptable. The system correctly did not find a match with sufficient confidence.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly states the product could not be found.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response informing the customer the item could not be found and suggests browsing or contacting customer service.
*   **E014**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" and extracts "Sleek Wallet".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves to SWL2345 "Sleek Wallet" using semantic search. Initial stock: 5.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 1 SWL2345 (stock becomes 4).
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the order.
*   **E015**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" for a "men's bag" that's "stylish and practical" for "work" and "hikes".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies "men's bag" as an unresolved mention.
    *   Advisor: Correctly identifies the unanswered question about recommending such a bag.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response explaining the difficulty of a single recommendation and suggests browsing or asking for personalized shopping.
*   **E016**: Issue
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" for a "dress" with specific criteria and a "travel bag".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies "a dress" and "some travel bag" as unresolved mentions.
    *   Advisor: States "unable to find specific product recommendations that perfectly match your detailed needs at this moment." This is acceptable as the request is very broad for "dress" and "travel bag" without further specifics, but it's slightly different from a "system error." It should clarify *why* it cannot find recommendations (too broad, needs more specifics).
    *   Composer: The response states it was "unable to find specific product recommendations" which is fine, but the Advisor's "unanswered_questions" should ideally reflect that the system needs more information rather than just listing the questions.
*   **E017**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" for "that popular item you sell".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies this as an unresolved mention due to vagueness.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly states no valid products were identified.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response asking for more specific details.
*   **E018**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" for "2 pairs of the retro sun glasses (RSG8901)".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves RSG8901. Stock is 0 (from E010, E011).
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly identifies RSG8901 as "out of stock" for the requested quantity of 2. Suggests alternatives. Stock for RSG8901 remains 0.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response informing the customer the item is out of stock.
*   **E019**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request". Extracts "Chelsea Boots [CBT 89 01]", "Fuzzy Slippers - FZZ1098" (as personal statement context), and "Retro sunglasses" (as future order).
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves CBT8901 (Initial stock: 2), FZZ1098 (Stock: 0 from E007), and RSG8901 (Stock: 0 from E010, E011, E018).
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly processes order for 1 CBT8901 (stock becomes 1). The other items are not part of the current order.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response confirming the CBT8901 order and acknowledging the other comments.
*   **E020**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry" for "Saddle bag" price and season suitability.
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies "Saddle bag" as an unresolved mention (SDE2345 is "Saddle Bag", but the customer didn't provide ID; semantic match might not have been strong enough or they have a different one in mind).
    *   Advisor: Correctly lists unanswered questions about price and season.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response stating the "Saddle bag" could not be identified and asks for more details.
*   **E021**: Issue
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "product inquiry". Extracts product IDs SDE2345, DJN8901, RGD7654, CRD3210 as personal statement context, and inquiry for "winter hats".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves the specified IDs. SDE2345 (Initial stock: 1), DJN8901 (Initial stock: 5), RGD7654 (Initial stock: 5), CRD3210 (Initial stock: 5). Identifies "winter hats" as an unresolved mention.
    *   Advisor: Correctly lists the resolved products. The question "are there any winter hats in your store?" is listed as unanswered. This is correct as there are no products explicitly named "winter hat" that are also hats. However, there are beanies (CHN0987, CLF2109) suitable for winter. The advisor *could* have suggested these as related items, but not doing so isn't strictly incorrect.
    *   Composer: The response correctly states no specific "winter hats" are available and suggests checking the website. This is acceptable. The main issue is the Advisor did not provide *any* answer or alternative for "winter hats".
*   **E022**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" for "amazing bags ... with geometric patterns".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly identifies this as an unresolved mention due to vagueness.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly states no valid products were identified.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response asking for more specific details.
*   **E023**: CORRECT
    *   Classifier: Correctly identifies intent as "order request" for "5 of them, CGN2345 Cargo Pants".
    *   Stockkeeper: Correctly resolves CGN2345. Initial stock: 2.
    *   Fulfiller: Correctly identifies CGN2345 as "out of stock" for the requested quantity of 5, as only 2 are available. Suggests alternatives. Stock for CGN2345 remains 2.
    *   Composer: Correctly generates a response informing the customer about the stock issue for CGN2345, asks if they want the available 2, and suggests alternatives.
