# Deduplication Functionality Removal

## Summary
Removed the deduplication functionality from the Stockkeeper agent as it was unnecessary complexity that didn't align with the assignment requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. `hermes/agents/stockkeeper/agent.py`
- Removed `run_deduplication_llm()` function
- Removed `deduplicate_mentions()` function
- Simplified `resolve_product_mentions()` to process all product mentions directly without deduplication
- Removed imports for `DeduplicationResult` and `DEDUPLICATION_PROMPT`
- Removed import for `get_llm_client`

### 2. `hermes/agents/stockkeeper/models.py`
- Removed `DeduplicationResult` Pydantic model

### 3. `hermes/agents/stockkeeper/prompts.py`
- Removed `DEDUPLICATION_PROMPT_STR` prompt template
- Removed `DEDUPLICATION_PROMPT` PromptTemplate object

## Rationale

The assignment requirements focus on:
1. **Email Classification** - Understanding email intent and extracting product mentions
2. **Product Resolution** - Finding products in the catalog that match mentions
3. **Advisory Services** - Providing recommendations and alternatives
4. **Order Fulfillment** - Processing orders and managing inventory

Deduplication was an unnecessary intermediate step that:
- Added complexity without clear business value
- Required additional LLM calls (cost and latency)
- Could potentially lose information by merging distinct product requests
- Wasn't mentioned in the assignment requirements

## Impact

- **Simplified Architecture**: The Stockkeeper now has a cleaner, more focused responsibility
- **Better Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary LLM calls for deduplication
- **Preserved Functionality**: All product mentions are still processed and resolved
- **Downstream Handling**: The Advisor and Fulfiller agents can handle any duplicate resolution during their LLM-based decision making

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass
- Product resolution functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to the API or workflow

## Future Considerations

If deduplication becomes necessary in the future, it could be:
1. Implemented as a separate preprocessing step before the Stockkeeper
2. Handled by the Classifier agent during email analysis
3. Managed by downstream agents (Advisor/Fulfiller) during their decision-making process
