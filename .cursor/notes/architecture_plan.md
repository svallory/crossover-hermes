# Hermes Architecture Implementation Plan

## Completed Strategic Decisions
We've now completed all architectural/strategic decisions:

1. **LangGraph Architecture**: Supervisor with specialized agents
2. **State Management**: Dataclasses with annotated fields
3. **Message Handling**: langchain_core.messages
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized Configuration class
5. **Tool Design**: Specialized tools with hybrid database
6. **Error Handling**: Focused validation at critical points
7. **Testing and Evaluation**: Basic testing with sample cases
8. **Scalability Considerations**: Category filtering and embedding best practices
9. **Vector Database Integration**: ChromaDB with product-level embeddings
10. **Configuration Pattern**: Simple Pydantic BaseModel with from_runnable_config
11. **LLM Integration**: Streamlined model initialization with single model
12. **Tool Definition**: Function-based with proper annotations
13. **RAG Implementation**: ChromaDB with product-level embeddings
14. **Error Handling**: Focused validation with Pydantic models
15. **Prompt Structure**: ChatPromptTemplate with system/user messages
16. **Response Generation**: Dedicated composition agent with templates
17. **Testing Strategy**: Basic testing with sample cases and validation
18. **Performance Optimization**: Token efficiency and embedding caching
19. **Code Organization**: Clean module structure with type hints
20. **Documentation**: README with diagram and focused inline docs
21. **Scaling Considerations**: Basic approach with demonstrated awareness

## Implementation Priorities

Now that we've answered all architectural/strategic questions, our focus should shift to implementation:

1. **State Structure** (High Priority)
   - Define the State dataclass with appropriate fields
   - Create reducers for state transitions

2. **Agent Implementation** (High Priority)
   - Implement the supervisor agent with basic flow control
   - Create specialized agents with appropriate tools

3. **RAG Setup** (High Priority)
   - Implement product catalog embedding
   - Set up ChromaDB with appropriate schema

4. **Tool Implementation** (Medium Priority)
   - Create product search tools
   - Implement order processing tools
   - Build response generation tools

5. **Testing** (Medium Priority)
   - Create sample test cases
   - Implement validation checks

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation should follow these guidelines:

1. **Focus on Working Code**: Prioritize a working end-to-end solution over perfection in individual components
2. **Demonstrate Best Practices**: Show understanding of LLM frameworks and RAG implementation
3. **Keep It Achievable**: Maintain scope appropriate for a 1-2 day implementation
4. **Clear Documentation**: Include comments explaining design decisions and scaling considerations

This plan ensures our reference solution demonstrates mastery of modern LLM application development without requiring an unrealistic implementation timeline.
